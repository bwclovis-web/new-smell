Eusapia 2024,"The case I allude to is that of an invalid woman who belongs to the humblest class of society. She is nearly thirty years old and very ignorant; her look is neither fascinating nor endowed with the power which modern criminologists call irresistible; but when she wishes, be it by day or by night, she can divert a curious group for an hour or so with the most surprising phenomena. Either bound to a seat or firmly held by the hands of the curious, she attracts to her the articles of furniture which surround her, lifts them up, holds them suspended in the air like Mahomet’s coffin, and makes them come down again with undulatory movements, as if they were obeying her will. She increases their weight or lessens it according to her pleasure. She raps or taps upon the walls, the ceiling, the floor, with fine rhythm and cadence. In response to the requests of the spectators, something like flashes of electricity shoot forth from her body, and envelop her or enwrap the spectators of these marvellous scenes. She draws upon cards that you hold out, everything that you want – figures, signatures, numbers, sentences – by just stretching out her hand toward the indicated place.",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/eusapia-evening-with-the-spirits-2024-WEB-600x484.jpg,Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab,"[""lilac"", ""candle wax"", ""tea - white""]",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/yule-2024/an-evening-with-the-spirits-2024/eusapia-2024-perfume-oil/

When the loop of patriarchy closes, it can feel inescapable. Yet the way to freedom has been here, in our monster stories, all along.

O Beautiful White Mother Death,"This Spiritualism is the nepenthe which the ancient philosophers sought, to prolong life for ever; you cast off your bodies like an old garment. The pathway of this new science is as clear to the spirit as the names of the constellations are to the astronomer. In the great realm of the spirit there is no room for death to abide ; he has gone out with the ignorance, and blindness, and prejudice of the past, and life, only life, remains as your inheritance.Mrs. Tappan then paused. After a moment’s silence she delivered the following inspirational poem:—O beautiful white mother Death,Thou silent and shadowy soul,Thou mystical, magical soul,How soothing and cooling thy breath!Ere the morning stars sang in their spheres,Thou didst dwell in the spirit of things,Brooding there with thy wonderful wings,Incubating the germs of the years.Coeval with Time and with Space,Thy sisters are Silence and Sleep ;Three sisters—Death, Silence, and Sleep,How strange and how still is thy face!In the marriage of matter to soul,”Thou wert wedded to young fiery Time,The now weary and hoary-haired Time,With him thou hast shared earth’s control.O beautiful spirit of Death,Thy brothers are Winter and Night;Stern Winter and shadowy Night,They bear thy still image and breath.Summer buds fall asleep in thy arms,’Neath the fleecy and soft-footed snow,The silent, pure, beautiful snow;And the earth their new life-being warms.All the world is endowed with thy breath,Summer splendours and purple of wineFlow out of this magic of thine,O beautiful angel of DeathWhat wonders in silence we seeThe lily grows pale in thy sight;The rose thro’ the long summer nightSighs its life out in fragrance to thee.O beautiful angel of Death,The beloved are thine, all are thine !They have drunk the nepenthe divine,They have felt the full flow of thy breath.Out into thy realm they are gone,Like the incense that greeteth the morn,On the wings of thy might they’re up-borne,As bright birds to thy Paradise flown.They are folded and safe in thy sight,Thro’ thy portals they pass from earth’s prison;From the cold clod of clay they have risen,To dwell in thy temple of light.O beautiful Angel of Life,Germs feel thee and burst into bloom,Souls see thee and rise from the tomb,With beauty and loveliness rife.On earth thou art named cold Death,Dim, dark, dismal, dire, dreadful Death,In heaven thou art “Angel of Life.”We are one with thy spirit, O Death ;We spring to thy arms unafraid,One with thee are our glad spirits made.We are born when we drink thy cold breath,—Oh, Angel of Life, lovely Death.",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/o-beautiful-white-mother-death-evening-with-the-spirits-2024-WEB-600x484.jpg,Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab,"[""rose"", ""lily - calla"", ""sandalwood"", ""amber - white"", ""rose sandalwood"", ""lily"", ""white mother"", ""orris""]",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/yule-2024/an-evening-with-the-spirits-2024/o-beautiful-white-mother-death-perfume-oil/

For the law that delivered you into my hand shall deliver me into a mightier hand.Your blood and my blood is naught but the sap that feeds the tree of heaven.”And when you crush an apple with your teeth, say to it in your heart,“Your seeds shall live in my body,And the buds of your tomorrow shall blossom in my heart,And your fragrance shall be my breath, And together we shall rejoice through all the seasons.”And in the autumn, when you gather the grapes of your vineyards for the winepress, say in your heart,“I too am a vineyard, and my fruit shall be gathered for the winepress,And like new wine I shall be kept in eternal vessels.”And in winter, when you draw the wine, let there be in your heart a song for each cup;And let there be in the song a remembrance for the autumn days, and for the vineyard, and for the winepress.Purple fig, honeyed dates, sweet red wine, and apples.",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ON-EATING-AND-DRINKING-web-The-Prophet-copy-600x473.jpg,Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab,"[""red wine"", ""tomorrow shall blossom"", ""red wine - sweet"", ""honey"", ""apple"", ""fig - purple"", ""date"", ""little lunacy"", ""apple"", ""activism""]",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/a-little-lunacy-limited-edition/the-prophet-2025-lunacy-fundraiser/on-eating-drinking-perfume-oil/

The Day Burned White,"Using the door, which was centrally placed in the wall like a mouth, the artists had sprayed a single, vast head onto the stripped plaster. The painting was more adroit than most she had seen, rife with detail that lent the image an unsettling veracity. The cheekbones jutting through skin the color of buttermilk; the teeth, sharpened to irregular points, all converging on the door. The sitter’s eyes were, owing to the room’s low ceiling, set mere inches above the upper lip, but this physical adjustment only lent force to the image, giving the impression that he had thrown his head back. Knotted strands of his hair snaked from his scalp across the ceiling. Was it a portrait? There was something naggingly specific in the details of the brows and the lines around the wide mouth; in the careful picturing of those vicious teeth. A nightmare certainly: a facsimile, perhaps, of something from a heroin fugue. Whatever its origins, it was potent. Even the illusion of door-as-mouth worked. The short passageway between living room and bedroom offered a passable throat, with a tattered lamp in lieu of tonsils. Beyond the gullet, the day burned white in the nightmare’s belly. The whole effect brought to mind a ghost train painting. The same heroic deformity, the same unashamed intention to scare. And it worked; she stood in the bedroom almost stupefied by the picture, its red-rimmed eyes fixing her mercilessly.",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/The-Day-Burned-White.png,Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab,"[""amber - golden"", ""amber - white"", ""white in"", ""oakmoss"", ""sickly"", ""buttermilk"", ""chalky"", ""sweet"", ""moss - spanish"", ""plaster""]",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/clive-barker/the-forbidden/day-burned-white/

"Who Would Not Tremble, Too? 2024","The new discovery of “Table Moving,” by means of an unseen power from the human hand, has only been introduced into England within the last few weeks; but it would be difficult to dingle out any scientific subject which has with such rapidity, taken so extensive a hold of the popular mind. If we travel by railway carriage, steamboat, or omnibus, this is the universal topic of conversation. From the aristocratic saloons of Belgravia to the “Parlours” of Whitechapel – the Green Park to the Cat and Mutton Fields, “table moving” is all the rage. From the Royal Institution, where the secretary pokes his head through a forest of electrical apparatus, to inform the audience that the facts are established, down to the humblest Mechanics’ Institute, all are full of it, and the tables, to quote the words of the old song – “are all a moving, move, move, moving,” – Every evening party must of course have its experiments; accordingly, gentlemen come provided with very elegant chapeaux for the occasion, and many an innocent flirtation occurs consequent on the proper arrangement of the little fingers of some of the fair operators. As “sweet eighteen,” with her blue eyes and golden locks, gracefully links her little finger with Charles’s, in a retired corner, what wonder if the hat should tremble? And Charles, being of course fond of poetry (his very name is a guarantee for that), cannot resist softly breathing into Lucy’s ear, that exquisite line from Waller, on his fair one’s harp –",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/who-would-not-tremble-too-evening-with-the-spirits-2024-WEB-600x484.jpg,Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab,"[""apple - green"", ""golden lock"", ""sandalwood - white"", ""honey - white"", ""lily of the valley"", ""orange blossom"", ""green park"", ""blue eye"", ""tea - jasmine""]",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/yule-2024/an-evening-with-the-spirits-2024/who-would-not-tremble-too-2024-perfume-oil/
Ogygia,"On to Pieria he stepped from the upper air, and swooped down upon the sea, and then sped over the wave like a bird, the cormorant, which in quest of fish over the dread gulfs of the unresting sea wets its thick plumage in the brine. In such wise did Hermes ride upon the multitudinous waves. But when he had reached the island which lay afar, then forth from the violet sea he came to land, and went his way until he came to a great cave, wherein dwelt the fair-tressed nymph; and he found her within. A great fire was burning on the hearth, and from afar over the isle there was a fragrance of cleft cedar and juniper, as they burned; but she within was singing with a sweet voice as she went to and fro before the loom, weaving with a golden shuttle. Round about the cave grew a luxuriant wood, alder and poplar and sweet-smelling cypress, wherein birds long of wing were wont to nest, owls and falcons and sea-crows with chattering tongues, who ply their business on the sea. And right there about the hollow cave ran trailing a garden vine, in pride of its prime, richly laden with clusters. And fountains four in a row were flowing with bright water hard by one another, turned one this way, one that. And round about soft meadows of violets and parsley were blooming. There even an immortal, who chanced to come, might gaze and marvel, and delight his soul; and there the messenger Argeiphontes stood and marvelled.",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/OGYGIA-1-600x467.jpg,Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab,"[""glistritha"", ""wood - cedar"", ""violet"", ""sea air"", ""luxuriant wood"", ""selino"", ""wood - alder"", ""juniper"", ""cedar"", ""parsley""]",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/general-catalog-perfume-oils/wanderlust/ogygia/

Armed with a wet towel he sallied forth to chase the alleged familiar and, cleverly flapping his cloth, he brought down the butterfly at a swoop.

Indescribable Solemnity and Fear,"After all these dreams there remained on waking a remembrance of having been in a place very nearly dark, and of having spoken to people whom I could not see; and especially of one clear voice, of a female’s, very deep, that spoke as if at a distance, slowly, and producing always the same sensation of indescribable solemnity and fear. Sometimes there came a sensation as if a hand was drawn softly along my cheek and neck. Sometimes it was as if warm lips kissed me, and longer and longer and more lovingly as they reached my throat, but there the caress fixed itself. My heart beat faster, my breathing rose and fell rapidly and full drawn; a sobbing, that rose into a sense of strangulation, supervened, and turned into a dreadful convulsion, in which my senses left me and I became unconscious.The crescendo of a phantom’s caress: golden frankincense and cardamom smothered by honeyed kisses of labdanum, red rose, merlot, black oud, and myrrh.",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/INDESCRIBABLE-SOLEMNITY-AND-FEAR-carmilla-WEB-2024-600x473.jpg,Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab,"[""kiss"", ""wine - merlot"", ""rose"", ""honey"", ""labdanum"", ""red rose"", ""frankincense - golden"", ""oud - black"", ""golden frankincense"", ""black oud""]",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/in-memoriam/halloween-2024/carmilla/indescribable-solemnity-and-fear-perfume-oil/

Phantom Team of Horses,"About two miles from the village of Canton, Me., is a cosey, old-fashioned farm-house which is located directly opposite a graveyard, with no other house in sight. From the window of this little house nothing can be seen except the graveyard with its gleaming stones, and the hills and mountains round about.The family that has been occupying the house moved out not long ago, declaring that they could not stand it any longer, that they were wellnight distracted by the demonstrations. When they told their story a former resident, who now lives in Hartford, announced that he had known for years that the place was haunted. He had not told any one for fear of the ridicule of his neighbors.The demonstrations were not only in the house, but in the barn and around the premises. Regularly every night at 12 o’clock a team of horses rushes from the direction of the village, rumbles over the little bridge at a slashing gait, and then disappears. It never reaches the house. Instead, ghostly voices address the members of the family who have the temerity to live there, the voices coming from all parts of the house, but never so clearly that they can be located.On one memorable night a member of the family went to the barn just at dusk without a lantern. A figure stood at the corner of the building, and he ran to learn what the straggler wanted about the place. The figure silently and mysteriously melted into the shadows and was gone.The Buffalo News, April 20, 1904A spectral cacophony of shimmering, translucent dun sandalwood, grey amber, and wraith-chilled chestnut galloping through the mist-cloaked shadows of time, a clattering of clove and black pepper, and a crack of phantom leather.",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/phantom-team-of-horses-evening-with-the-spirits-2024-WEB-600x484.jpg,Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab,"[""amber - grey"", ""sandalwood"", ""amber"", ""clove"", ""pepper - black"", ""chestnut"", ""black pepper"", ""leather""]",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/yule-2024/an-evening-with-the-spirits-2024/phantom-team-of-horses-perfume-oil/

All Worlds are in Motion,"Electricity, which is an atmospheric emanation from God, and which is moved by his will, is that substance out of which all worlds and their splendid appendages were made. Hence, it will be perceived, that electricity contains all the original properties of all the various substances in being. All the varieties of the universe around us – all the beauties and glories of creation upon which we look with so many thrilling emotions of delight, were produced from electricity, which is the inexhaustible fountain of primal matter. By the living energies of the Divine Mind, electricity was condensed into globes ; not instantly, but gradually. The heaviest particle took the lowest point, or common centre, of our globe, and so on, step by step, lighter and lighter, till we reach the surface, which is a regular mould. On this we find water, a substance still lighter than earth ; next air, which is lighter than water, and so on till we reach the sun, which is the highest point in relation to our system, because it is the common centre. The sun is, therefore, pure electricity. Hence, the twenty-nine globes, belonging to our system, are electrically, geologically, and magnetically made. They are but twenty-nine magnets revolving around our sun as a centre. The sun being pure electricity or primal matter, is but an emanation from the Deity. It is consequently in a positive state. Hence, electricity is continually passing from the sun, as a common centre to the twenty-nine surrounding worlds : on the same principle that it passes from a positive to a negative cloud. Having done its duty in giving light, heat, and vegetation, as well as magnetic power to the globes, it is returned by reaction to the sun, and these two motions from the vertices that roll worlds around him. It is impossible that there can be any inherent attraction or repulsion in matter. Attraction and repulsion are but different dispositions of electricity. The best magnets are now made for the galvanic battery. Hence, electricity, galvanism and magnetism, are but in substance one and the same fluid, and the Eternal Mind, so that all the powers of attraction and repulsion originated in Deity. His will comes in contact with electricity, and through that subtle agent he moves the whole immeasurable universe in accordance with nature’s law.All worlds are in motion. They roll rapid as the lightning’s blaze, and in the most apparent confusion ; yet all is calm, regular, and harmonious. God is, therefore, connected with his universe, and superintends all its multifarious operations. Tho’ he is thus intimately united with inert matter, yet is he distinct from the whole.Thou apart,Above, beyond ; O tell me, mighty Mind,Where art thou? Shall I dive into the deep:Call to the sun? or ask the roaring windsFor their Creator! Shall I question loudThe thunder, if in that the Almighty dwells!Or holds he furious storms in straitened reins,And bids fierce whirlwinds wheel his rapid car!The Pittsburgh Post, 9 August 1847",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/all-worlds-are-in-motion-evening-with-the-spirits-2024-WEB-600x484.jpg,Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab,"[""ambergris accord"", ""lavender - white"", ""musk - mineralic"", ""violet leaf"", ""metallic aldehyde"", ""lemon pith"", ""patchouli""]",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/yule-2024/an-evening-with-the-spirits-2024/all-worlds-are-in-motion-perfume-oil/

skekTek the Scientist,"SkekTek the Scientist kept some real power of thought, but in truth he had become only a juggler of ideas, of memories from his previous life.

First, he learned the art to make beams of light from the Dark Crystal, which he burned into the eyes of the Pod People and Gelfling to make them his slaves. After the light had struck them, no light lived in their eyes, but they obeyed. And the second evil was to use dark light to draw the essence of life, to drain it from the living to make a drink for the Skeksis, above all for the Emperor.

Resembling the Passion of Love,"The vampire is prone to be fascinated with an engrossing vehemence, resembling the passion of love, by particular persons. In pursuit of these it will exercise inexhaustible patience and stratagem, for access to a particular object may be obstructed in a hundred ways. It will never desist until it has satiated its passion, and drained the very life of its coveted victim. But it will, in these cases, husband and protract its murderous enjoyment with the refinement of an epicure, and heighten it by the gradual approaches of an artful courtship. In these cases it seems to yearn for something like sympathy and consent. In ordinary ones it goes direct to its object, overpowers with violence, and strangles and exhausts often at a single feast.All-consuming, relentless desire – deceptively luscious, murderously brooding, and blindingly sensual: blood musk, black cherry, crimson amber, 21-year aged patchouli, golden saffron, jasmine sambac, and black rose.",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/RESEMBLING-THE-PASSION-OF-LOVE-carmilla-WEB-2024-600x473.jpg,Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab,"[""golden saffron"", ""cherry - black"", ""rose"", ""amber - crimson"", ""cherry"", ""saffron - golden"", ""musk"", ""carmilla"", ""musk - blood"", ""patchouli - 21 year aged""]",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/in-memoriam/halloween-2024/carmilla/resembling-the-passion-of-love-perfume-oil/

When one of these men dies, God chooses another to take his place. It is for their sake and for love of them that God does not destroy His imperfect creation. As long as the Lamed Vav serves humanity, the world will continue to plod on, but once one of them dies and God cannot find another worthy to take his place, the world will be destroyed.

Witch-Birds,"In Sweden tradition says that sorcerers  on Walpurgis night ride to Blocula and there turn into magpies. A lady at Carlstadt in that country was haunted by witch-birds in a very unpleasant manner. Having insulted a Finn woman who had begged food of her she told her to take a magpie that was hanging in a cage and eat it if she was hungry. The Finn cast an ‘evil eye’ on the lady for this insult but took the bird away with her. Some time after the Swedish lady noticed that whenever she went out a magpie came hopping in front of her. This happened for some days running, and then the magpie was joined by a companion bird, and presently by a number. The lady began to get frightened, but the more she tried to get rid of these strange companions the more numerous they became. They perched on her shoulders, tugged at her dress, and pecked at her ankles. In despair she shut herself up indoors, but they remained outside, and as soon as the door was open in they hopped. At last she went to bed and had the shutters closed, and the magpies kept on tapping outside till she died.",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Human-Animals-WITCH-BIRDS-web-600x473.jpg,Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab,"[""indigo opium pod accord"", ""human animal 2023"", ""mallow - white"", ""halloween 2023"", ""plum - wild"", ""vanilla sandalwood"", ""opoponax""]",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/in-memoriam/halloween/halloween-2023/human-animals/witch-birds-perfume-oil/

Obatala,"The King of the White Cloth, King of the Orishas, the First Among Equals. He is the King of Power, and his weapon is wisdom. He is the essence of honored maturity, wisdom through age and experience, purity of intention, virtue, humility, tolerance, judicious use of power, the knowledge of what is truly right and wrong, the moral code, and the obligation to do what is right. Obatala is the Creator God, who first fashioned mankind from clay; thus, he is also the first sculptor and potter. The human head itself is Obatala’s creation, and it is through it that he grants us the ability to discern genuine morality as opposed to oppressive, mistaken and arrogant self-righteousness. His is not the falsehood of societal boundaries, His Truth is the understanding of one’s own character and the obligations that we all have to our world, our Gods, and one another. He is the Benevolent Judge, calm and lucid, and he governs rational deliberation. His color is white, as His spirit is free from any soil or stain, and His energy radiates sanctified purity, great wisdom, happiness and internal peace. He is associated with cloth, as that was one of His gifts to mankind. The aspects of Obatala are symbolized by the chameleon, boa constrictor, elephant, gorilla, and snail. Obatala is the Lord of Laughter, for it is through wisdom that one may see the joy in life, and through laughter we are able to see the follies of mankind not with cynicism and derision, but with humor, compassion and understanding. Obatala’s Laughter helps soothe the pain of life’s rigors, and takes the sting out of the harshest of life’s lessons. Obatala’s ofrenda is soft, white and pure: milk, coconut meat, shea butter and cool, refreshing water.",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/obatala-1-600x467.jpg,Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab,"[""deliberation"", ""white and"", ""shea butter"", ""goodness"", ""color - white"", ""wisdom"", ""creation"", ""morality"", ""humility"", ""intention""]",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/general-catalog-perfume-oils/excolo/obatala/

Shango,"The Wrath of God, the Most Beautiful Lord of Lightning, the Owner of All Palaces. He is the illumination of a lightning strike in the night sky, and is the retributive strike of the rightful king. Shango punishes those who are not living up to their responsibilities. He gives insight to the truth in all circumstances, and is the essence of the thrill and excitement in life that makes every day worth living. To love Shango is to live life to the fullest, no matter what pains the world inflicts upon you. He is Wrath, and his lightning bolts and gouts of fire remind all of his strength and power. It is said that Lord Shango only speaks to his children once; when the God illuminates an answer for you, you had best understand with no further questions. Shango is trial by fire, the honing and refinement of the spirit, the ability to distinguish between truth and lies. He is a dual-faced God: King and Exile, miser and philanthropist, just and ruthless, honest and devious. Shango is the Lord of Persuasion, and his glib tongue can intimidate, coerce, sway and seduce. He is quick wit, articulate words, and the ability to think on one’s feet. He is the King that can incite and enflame the masses with the power of his speech. His words are the sensual murmurs of the lothario, the slick wheedle of the grifter, the convincing argument of the barrister, the dangerous charm of the pimp, the inspiration of the warrior general, and the invigorating exhortations of the monarch. The Roar of Shango is a Universal Truth. Shango governs all professions that cater to the needs and weaknesses of the people. He is the absolute and perfect Male creature, and the rain that falls to earth is His blessed, sublime semen, giving life to the world. His abundant seed washes the land and replenishes Earth’s seas, rivers and oceans. He sneers at cowardice, and demands that all of his children have daring spirits, strength of will, nerve and *balls*. Courage is of the utmost importance, as it empowers us to face adversity with dignity and enables us to act decisively and with resourcefulness. Live, don’t simply exist. Shango’s gifts make it possible for us to find the shortest distance between two points, wring out the best from every situation, recover from every seeming loss and every defeat, and defy all odds to reach our goals. He teaches us wily strategies, masterful tactics, and shows us the value of friendship and camaraderie. His is the comfortable, casual friendship found in just hanging out and having a good time with the guys. Shango is Challenge, the concept of finding the best parts of yourself through conflict and adversity. Shango’s weapon is the double-headed axe, and His animals are the black cat and the leopard.",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/shango-600x467.jpg,Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab,"[""banana"", ""black cat"", ""pomegranate"", ""chili pepper"", ""apple - red"", ""is the absolute"", ""lightning"", ""sugar cane"", ""orisha"", ""pineapple""]",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/general-catalog-perfume-oils/excolo/shango/

A Cup of Tea in the Verandah,"Whilst I was residing at Maulmain I saw a ghost with my own eyes in broad daylight, of which I could make an affidavit. I had an old schoolfellow, who was afterwards a college friend, with whom I had lived in the closest intimacy. Years, however, had passed away without our seeing each other. One morning I had just got out of bed, and was dressing myself, when suddenly my old friend entered the room. I greeted him warmly, told him to call for a cup of tea in the verandah, and promised to be with him immediately. I dressed myself in all haste, and went out into the verandah, but found no one there. I could not believe my eyes. I called to the sentry, who was posted at the front of the house, but he had seen no strange gentlemen that morning, The servants also declared that no such person had entered the house. I was certain I had seen my friend. I was not thinking about him at the time : yet I was not taken by surprise, as steamers and other vessel were frequently arriving at Maulmain. A fortnight afterwards, news arrived that he had died, six hundred miles off, almost the very time I saw him at Maulmain. It is useless to comment upon this story. To this day I have never doubted that I really saw the ghost of my deceased friend.Banbury Advertiser, 18 July 1878A fragrance steeped in wistful melancholy and the ache of near-forgotten longing.

On Giving,"You give but little when you give of your possessions.It is when you give of yourself that you truly give.For what are your possessions but things you keep and guard for fear you may need them tomorrow?And tomorrow, what shall tomorrow bring to the overprudent dog burying bones in the trackless sand as he follows the pilgrims to the holy city?And what is fear of need but need itself?Is not dread of thirst when your well is full, the thirst that is unquenchable?There are those who give little of the much which they have—and they give it for recognition and their hidden desire makes their gifts unwholesome.And there are those who have little and give it all.These are the believers in life and the bounty of life, and their coffer is never empty.There are those who give with joy, and that joy is their reward.And there are those who give with pain, and that pain is their baptism.And there are those who give and know not pain in giving, nor do they seek joy, nor give with mindfulness of virtue;They give as in yonder valley the myrtle breathes its fragrance into space.Through the hands of such as these God speaks, and from behind their eyes He smiles upon the earth.It is well to give when asked, but it is better to give unasked, through understanding;And to the open-handed the search for one who shall receive is joy greater than giving.And is there aught you would withhold?All you have shall some day be given;Therefore give now, that the season of giving may be yours and not your inheritors’.You often say, “I would give, but only to the deserving.”The trees in your orchard say not so, nor the flocks in your pasture.They give that they may live, for to withhold is to perish.Surely he who is worthy to receive his days and his nights, is worthy of all else from you.And he who has deserved to drink from the ocean of life deserves to fill his cup from your little stream.And what desert greater shall there be, than that which lies in the courage and the confidence, nay the charity, of receiving?And who are you that men should rend their bosom and unveil their pride, that you may see their worth naked and their pride unabashed?See first that you yourself deserve to be a giver, and an instrument of giving.For in truth it is life that gives unto life — while you, who deem yourself a giver, are but a witness.And you receivers — and you are all receivers — assume no weight of gratitude, lest you lay a yoke upon yourself and upon him who gives.Rather rise together with the giver on his gifts as on wings;For to be overmindful of your debt, is to doubt his generosity who has the freehearted earth for mother, and God for father.They give that they may live, for to withhold is to perish: pomegranate, rose, myrrh, frankincense, and neroli.",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/On-Giving-The-Prophet-WEB-600x473.jpg,Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab,"[""pomegranate"", ""rose"", ""neroli"", ""myrrh"", ""little lunacy"", ""frankincense"", ""activism""]",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/a-little-lunacy-limited-edition/the-prophet-2025-lunacy-fundraiser/on-giving-perfume-oil/

Wanda,"“And yet a restless, always unsatisfied craving for the nudity of paganism,” she interrupted, “but that love, which is the highest joy, which is divine simplicity itself, is not for you moderns, you children of reflection. It works only evil in you. As soon as you wish to be natural, you become common. To you nature seems something hostile; you have made devils out of the smiling gods of Greece, and out of me a demon. You can only exorcise and curse me, or slay yourselves in bacchantic madness before my altar. And if ever one of you has had the courage to kiss my red mouth, he makes a barefoot pilgrimage to Rome in penitential robes and expects flowers to grow from his withered staff, while under my feet roses, violets, and myrtles spring up every hour, but their fragrance does not agree with you. Stay among your northern fogs and Christian incense; let us pagans remain under the debris, beneath the lava; do not disinter us.

Search was made in every direction but to no success.“A gentleman of that place decided to call in the aid of Mrs. Stevens; she told him somebody was lost, and not being able to visit the place she drew a map or chart of the locality, giving directions, by which, on his return he was immediately found alive, but died the next day. The day following I was at South Sangerville, and stopping at this gentleman’s house, examined the map, which was perfect in every respect. The house and shed were correctly drawn, the mill and pond near the house were marked, the field and woods, two fences over which Mr. Prescott must climb, even to the swinging of the road by the house was definitely given.“The spot where she said he was, was shown by a large black mark, and he was found exactly in that place.

The Phenomena of Witchcraft,"The Rev. Joseph Glanvil, chaplain in ordinary to Charles II., was a writer of great erudition and ability. In his “Sadducismus Triumphatus,” written to show that the phenomena of witchcraft were genuine occurrences, he gives an account of Mr. Mompesson’s haunted house at Tedworth, where it was observed that, on beating or calling for any tune, it would be exactly answered by drumming. When asked by some one to give three knocks, if it were a certain spirit, it gave three knocks and no more. Other questions were put, and answered by knocks exactly. Glanvil himself says, that, being told it would imitate noises, he scratched, on the sheet of the bed, five, then seven, then ten times ; and it returned exactly the number of scratches each time.Melanethon relates that at Oppenheim, in Germany, in 1620, the same experiment of rapping, and having the raps exactly answered by the spirit which haunted a house, was successfully tried ; and he tells us that Luther was visited by a spirit who announced his coming by “a rapping at his door.”In the famous Wesley case, the haunting of the house of John Wesley’s father, the Parsonage at Epworth, Lincolnshire, in 1716, for a period of two months, the supposed spirit used to imitate Mr. Wesley’s knock at the gate. It responded to the Amen at prayers. Emily, one of the daughters, knocked ; and it answered her. Mr. Wesley knocked a stick on the joists of the kitchen ; and it knocked again, in number of strokes and in loudness exactly replying. When Mrs. Wesley stamped, it knocked in reply.It is not surprising that John Wesley was a Spiritualist. “With my last breath,” he writes, “will I bear my testimony against giving up to infidels one great proof of the invisible world ; I mean that of witchcraft, confirmed by the testimony of all ages.”",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/the-phenomena-of-witchcraft-evening-with-the-spirits-2024-WEB-600x484.jpg,Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab,"[""oud"", ""bay leaf"", ""clove bud"", ""balsam - green"", ""vetiver - blackened"", ""amber - fossilized""]",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/yule-2024/an-evening-with-the-spirits-2024/the-phenomena-of-witchcraft-perfume-oil/

The Human Double,"Among the most intelligent inquirers with whom I converse at Brighton was a lady of title. She told me that she was one of those present at the Davenport séance, held at the residence of Sir Hesketh Fleetwood. She was seated in the dark séance by the side of a gentleman whose previous scepticism, he confessed to her, was fast disappearing in the face of the facts they were witnessing, when a light was suddenly struck, and both of them distinctly saw the form of Ira Davenport glide close past them. This incident very much disturbed the confidence of Lady L—, and entirely satisfied the sceptic that imposition was practiced, and he left the room a confirmed unbeliever. I told Lady L—that, on his return to London, Mr. Ferguson spoke to me of this very fact, as one of the most curious that had yet occurred at any of the séances. He was holding, he said, the box of matches, as he usually does, when the box was snatched from his hand, and a light was struck by the invisible operator, and during the momentary ignition of the match he plainly saw a form, apparently of a human figure. He said nothing at the moment, but whispering the fact to Mr. Fay, he confirmed it, and afterwards several of those present admitted that that, too, had seen it. Mr. Ferguson, however, was not aware that anyone present supposed it to be the actual person of Ira Davenport, as no observation to that effect was made, and as Ira Davenport was seen instantly afterwards when the light was restored, fast bound to his chair, it was simply impossible that the suspicions of Lady L—or her friend could have been well founded.But, admitting that two competent witnesses did actually see the form of Ira Davenport on that occasion, it is corroborative of a very important and interesting fact, and distinct phase of these puzzling mysteries of spiritual appearances – viz., the duplication of individual form. Mr. Ferguson, who did not on that occasion recognize the resemblance to Ira Davenport, nevertheless has, as he solemnly asserts, seen at other times, when alone with them, the entire duplicated form of Ira Davenport, and a part of Mr. Fay ; and in my first conversation with the Davenport Brothers they told me, among other curious facts of their extraordinary history, that persons had said they had met one or other of them in places where they had not been. On one occasion their father went to a neighbouring shop to order some fruit, when he was told by the shopkeeper that his son Ira had just been there, and had ordered the fruit. It was, however, satisfactorily proved that Ira had not left the house, and that the man must have seen his “wraith,” or “double.”The Spiritualist, December 19, 1873",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/the-human-double-evening-with-the-spirits-2024-WEB-600x484.jpg,Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab,"[""fougere"", ""lavender tar""]",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/yule-2024/an-evening-with-the-spirits-2024/the-human-double-perfume-oil/

The Hound and the Milk-White Doe,"The Lady Sybil of Bernshaw Tower, a fair maid of high rank but evil repute, turned into a white doe after making a strange compact with the devil. Rich, young, and beautiful, her desires were still unsatisfied and she longed for supernatural powers, so that she might take part in the witches’ Sabbath. At this time, Lord William of Hapton Tower (a member of the Townley family) was a suitor for Lady Sybil’s hand, but his proposals did not meet with her approval. In despair, he decided to consult a famous Lancashire witch called Mother Helston, who promised him success on All Halloween. In accordance with her instructions he went hunting and at a short distance from the Eagle’s Crag, a milk-white doe started from behind the thicket, and he found it impossible to capture the animal. His hounds were wearied and he returned to the Crag, almost determined to give up the chase, when a strange hound joined his pack. Then a fresh start was made, and the strange hound, Mother Helston’s familiar, captured the white doe. That night an earthquake shook Hapton Tower to its foundations and in the morning the white doe appeared as the fair Lady Sybil, who had been fleeing from her suitor in animal shape. Thus Lord William married the heiress of Bernshaw Tower, but a year later she renewed her diabolical practices and not until she lay near death was it possible for Lord William to have the devil’s bond cancelled, which he did by enlisting the holy offices of a neighboring priest. After her death Bernshaw Tower was deserted and tradition says that on All Halloween, the hound and the milk-white doe meet on the Eagle’s Crag, where Lady Sybil lies buried, and are pursued by a spectre huntsman in full chase.",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Human-Animals-THE-HOUND-AND-THE-MILK-WHITE-DOE-web-600x473.jpg,Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab,"[""human animal 2023"", ""liquidambar"", ""labdanum"", ""milk - coconut"", ""halloween 2023"", ""jasmine sambac"", ""cardamom"", ""sandalwood - golden"", ""white doe"", ""rosewater""]",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/in-memoriam/halloween/halloween-2023/human-animals/the-hound-and-the-milk-white-doe-perfume-oil/

The Fox Sisters 2024,"For the sake of continuity the subsequent history of the Fox sisters will now be given after the events at Hydesville. It is a remarkable, and to Spiritualists a painful, story, but it bears its own lesson and should be faithfully recorded. When men have an honest and whole-hearted aspiration for truth there is no development which can ever leave them abashed or find no place in their scheme.For some years the two younger sisters, Kate and Margaret, gave séances at New York and other places, successfully meeting every test which was applied to them. Horace Greeley, afterwards a candidate for the United States presidency, was, as already shown, deeply interested in them and convinced of their entire honesty. He is said to have furnished the funds by which the younger girl completed her very imperfect education.During these years of public mediumship, when the girls were all the rage among those who had no conception of the religious significance of this new revelation, and who concerned themselves with it purely in the hope of worldly advantage, the sisters exposed themselves to the enervating influences of promiscuous séances in a way which no earnest Spiritualist could justify. The dangers of such practices were not then so clearly realized as now, nor had it occurred to people that it is unlikely that high spirits would descend to earth in order to advise as to the state of railway stocks or the issue of love affairs. The ignorance was universal, and there was no wise mentor at the elbow of these poor pioneers to point the higher and the safer path. Worst of all, their jaded energies were renewed by the offer of wine at a time when one at least of them was hardly more than a child. It is said that there was some family predisposition towards alcoholism, but even without such a taint their whole procedure and mode of life were rash to the last degree. Against their moral character there has never been a breath of suspicion, but they had taken a road which leads to degeneration of mind and character, though it was many years before the more serious effects were manifest.",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/the-fox-sisters-evening-with-the-spirits-2024-WEB-600x484.jpg,Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab,"[""mahogany wood"", ""vanilla bourbon"", ""tea ros"", ""apple peel"", ""rose geranium""]",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/yule-2024/an-evening-with-the-spirits-2024/the-fox-sisters-2024-perfume-oil/

Dead Blonde,"“Of course young women enjoy slashers. Adolescent girls have spent their lives absorbing our cultural disgust for womanhood, only to find themselves thrust into the middle of it, suddenly the butt of every joke. Their underlying anxieties are hit with a toxic sludge of predatory attention, sexual objectification, and impossible standards, growing to fifty times their natural size. It is not easy to become a monster. It is not fun to slip – suddenly and for the rest of your life – out of humanity and into womanhood. Girls are left reckoning with the fact that their social status, their human value, even their basic survival, are all suddenly contingent on men. Thus, at the exact moment they’re beginning to have sex and enter romantic relationships, girls watch stories in which a moment’s lapse in judgment, or a single instance of giving in to temptation, results and agony and annihilation – not because that’s what they want, but because it’s already happening, and they have precious few other ways to process it.”",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DBDM-web-DEAD-BLONDE-600x470.jpg,Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab,"[""rose - tea"", ""perfume oil"", ""rose - white"", ""honey"", ""coconut""]",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/collaborations/dead-blondes-and-bad-mothers/dead-blonde-perfume-oil/

If one has left this entire system to itself for an hour, one would say that the cat still lives if meanwhile no atom has decayed. The first atomic decay would have poisoned it. The Psi function for the entire system would express this by having in it the living and the dead cat (pardon the expression) mixed or smeared out in equal parts. It is typical of these cases that an indeterminacy originally restricted to the atomic domain becomes transformed into macroscopic indeterminacy, which can then be resolved by direct observation. That prevents us from so naively accepting as valid a “blurred model” for representing reality. In itself it would not embody anything unclear or contradictory. There is a difference between a shaky or out-of-focus photograph and a snapshot of clouds and fog banks.",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/BPAL_logo_circle_Placeholder_T.jpg,Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab,"[""lime"", ""peppermint"", ""tangerine"", ""oakmoss"", ""lavender"", ""paradox"", ""grapefruit - pink"", ""zdravetz"", ""sugar"", ""animal - cat""]",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/general-catalog-perfume-oils/bewitching-brews/schrodingers-cat/

Practical Occultism 2024,"Practical Occultism consists, first, of a perfect mastery of the individual’s own spirit. No advance whatever can be made in acquiring power over other spirits, such as controlling the lower or supplicating the higher, until the spirit within has acquired such perfect mastery of itself, that it can never be moved to anger or emotion—realizes no pleasure, cares for no pain; experiences no mortification at insult, loss, or disappointment—in a word, subdues every emotion that stirs common men’s minds.To arrive at this state, severe and painful as well as long continued discipline is necessary. Having acquired this perfect equilibrium, the next step is power. The individual must be able to wake when he pleases and sleep when he pleases; go in spirit during bodily sleep where he will, and visit—as well as remember when awake—distant scenes.He must be enabled by practice, to telegraph, mentally, with his fellow associates, and present himself, spiritually, in their midst.He must, by practice, acquire psychological control over the minds of any persons—not his associates—beneath his own calibre of mind. He must be able to still a crying infant, subdue fierce animals or angry men, and by will, transfer his thought without speech or outward sign to any person of a mental calibre below himself; he must be enabled to summon to his presence elementary spirits, and if he desires to do so (knowing the penalties attached), to make them serve him in the special departments of Nature to which they belong.He must, by virtue of complete subjugation of his earthly nature, be able to invoke Planetary and even Solar Spirits, and commune with them to a certain degree.To attain these degrees of power the processes are so difficult that a thorough practical occultist can scarcely become one and yet continue his relations with his fellow-men.He must continue, from the first to the last degree, a long series of exercises, each one of which must be perfected before another is undertaken.A practical occultist may be of either sex, but must observe as the first law inviolable chastity—and that with a view of conserving all the virile powers of the organism. No aged person, especially one who has not lived the life of strict chastity, can acquire the full sum of the powers above named. It is better to commence practice in early youth, for after the meridian of life, when the processes of waste prevail over repair, few of the powers above described can be attained; the full sum never.Strict abstinence from animal food and all stimulants is necessary. Frequent ablutions and long periods of silent contemplation are essential. Codes of exercises for the attainment of these powers can be prescribed, but few, if any, of the self-indulgent livers of modern times can perform their routine.The arts necessary for study to the practical occultist are, in addition to those prescribed in speculative occultism, a knowledge of the qualities of drugs, vapors, minerals, electricity, perfumes, fumigations, and all kinds of anæsthetics.And now, having given in brief as much as is consistent with my position—as the former associate of a secret society—I have simply  to add, that, whilst there are, as in Masonry, certain preliminary degrees to pass through, there are numerous others to which a thoroughly well organized and faithful association might advance. In each degree there are some valuable elements of practical occultism demanded, whilst the teachings conveyed are essential preliminaries. In a word, speculative occultism must precede practical occultism; the former is love and wisdom, the latter, simply power.A Victorian occultist’s incense, invoking the Four Archangels: precious wildcrafted Indian frankincense with myrrh, cassia, sandarac, palmarosa, white sage, red sandalwood, elemi, and drops of star anise bound with grains of kyphi.",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/practical-occultism-evening-with-the-spirits-2024-WEB-600x484.jpg,Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab,"[""sandalwood - red"", ""palmarosa"", ""sage"", ""kyphi"", ""sandalwood"", ""red sandalwood"", ""sandarac"", ""white sage"", ""elemi"", ""anise - star""]",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/yule-2024/an-evening-with-the-spirits-2024/practical-occultism-2024-perfume-oil/

Which way?’, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.Three white cakes, vanilla, and red and black currants.BPAL’s Eat Me is not for eating.

On Work,"You work that you may keep pace with the earth and the soul of the earth.For to be idle is to become a stranger unto the seasons, and to step out of life’s procession, that marches in majesty and proud submission towards the infinite.When you work you are a flute through whose heart the whispering of the hours turns to music.Which of you would be a reed, dumb and silent, when all else sings together in unison?Always you have been told that work is a curse and labour a misfortune.But I say to you that when you work you fulfil a part of earth’s furthest dream, assigned to you when that dream was born,And in keeping yourself with labour you are in truth loving life,And to love life through labour is to be intimate with life’s inmost secret.But if you in your pain call birth an affliction and the support of the flesh a curse written upon your brow, then I answer that naught but the sweat of your brow shall wash away that which is written.You have been told also that life is darkness, and in your weariness you echo what was said by the weary.And I say that life is indeed darkness ‘save when there is urge,And all urge is blind save when there is knowledge,And all knowledge is vain save when there is work,And all work is empty save when there is love;And when you work with love you bind yourself to yourself, and to one another, and to God.And what is it to work with love?It is to weave the cloth with threads drawn from your heart, even as if your beloved were to wear that cloth.It is to build a house with affection, even as if your beloved were to dwell in that house.It is to sow seeds with tenderness and reap the harvest with joy, even as if your beloved were to eat the fruit.It is to charge all things you fashion with a breath of your own spirit,And to know that all the blessed dead are standing about you and watching.Often have I heard you say, as if speaking in sleep, “He who works in marble, and finds the shape of his own soul in the stone, is nobler than he who ploughs the soil. And he who seizes the rainbow to lay it on a cloth in the likeness of man, is more than he who makes the sandals for our feet.”But I say, not in sleep but in the overwakefulness of noontide, that the wind speaks not more sweetly to the giant oaks than to the least of all the blades of grass;And he alone is great who turns the voice of the wind into a song made sweeter by his own loving.Work is love made visible.And if you cannot work with love but only with distaste, it is better that you should leave your work and sit at the gate of the temple and take alms of those who work with joy.For if you bake bread with indifference, you bake a bitter bread that feeds but half man’s hunger.And if you grudge the crushing of the grapes, your grudge distils a poison in the wine. And if you sing though as angels, and love not the singing, you muffle man’s ears to the voices of the day and the voices of the night.",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ON-WORK-web-The-Prophet-copy-600x473.jpg,Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab,"[""fig"", ""sandalwood - white"", ""angelica"", ""vanilla bourbon"", ""little lunacy"", ""activism""]",https://blackphoenixalchemylab.com/shop/a-little-lunacy-limited-edition/the-prophet-2025-lunacy-fundraiser/on-work-perfume-oil/

The Lights of Men’s Lives,"When Death saw that for a second time he was defrauded of his own property, he walked up to the physician with long strides, and said, “All is over with thee, and now the lot falls on thee,” and seized him so firmly with his ice-cold hand, that he could not resist, and led him into a cave below the earth. There he saw how thousands and thousands of candles were burning in countless rows, some large, others half-sized, others small. Every instant some were extinguished, and others again burnt up, so that the flames seemed to leap hither and thither in perpetual change. “See,” said Death, “these are the lights of men’s lives. The large ones belong to children, the half-sized ones to married people in their prime, the little ones belong to old people; but children and young folks likewise have often only a tiny candle.” “Show me the light of my life,” said the physician, and he thought that it would be still very tall.
