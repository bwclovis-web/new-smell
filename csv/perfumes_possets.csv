Van Gogh Desecrated For Charity Perfume Oil,"Oh, the horror of earnest ladies handling valuable artwork without knowing what they are doing! The destruction which has been wreaked is enormous! But they did smell good during the event! So good that anyone could forgive their sins against the arts. Honey, and plenty of it, on top of vanilla (in the gooiest of all manifestations, the Mexican persuasion) and a spot of an amazing amazing sugar musk which is an exceptionally powerful elixir! Oh, the beauty of it all, this stuff is so pretty that you could forgive a multitude of sins committed by anyone wearing it.

Sea of Ice (Friedrich) Perfume Oil,"A famous painting and eerie, this shows an ice pack that has crushed itself with shards jutting upward in a knifelike tangle. Buried deep in the recesses of the chaos is a doomed ship tipped over with no speck of human life nearby. In the grip of the heat of summer, it is prudent to produce an unabashedly chilling product. So, Possets gives you Sea of Ice, a perfume that combines the tang of marine life with the quietude of things cooling. Another aquatic base is frozen into a sculpture by way of mint, lime, birch, and green tea ice cubes. Put this on and be refreshed. It's like a sharp spray of 31-degree water.",https://possets.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/sea-of-ice-600x600.jpg,Possets,"[""another aquatic base is frozen into a sculpture by way of mint"", ""lime"", ""birch"", ""green tea ice cube""]",[],[],https://possets.com/product/sea-of-ice-fredrich-perfume-oil/
Silver Chypre Perfume Oil,"Just the thing to remind you of dark and chilly days, beautiful melancholy and the excitement of a bit of unease. Silver Chypre takes the beauty and sweetness of the silver accord and blends it seamlessly with the bitter and totally grown up chypre made by Possets and the result is a perfectly balanced perfume which is gourmandy but that compliments the dry and fabulous green and leathery chypre. Astoundingly good stuff. The name ""chypre"" means the Island of Cyprus where the original formula was invented, and the blend was forever after named after the place of its origin. *Oil is bottled in cobalt blue glass bottles, not the silver bottle pictured.",https://possets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/silverchypre-1-600x604.jpg,Possets,"[""*oil is bottled in cobalt blue glass bottle"", ""not the silver bottle pictured""]",[],[],https://possets.com/product/silver-chypre-perfume-oil/
DNA Perfume Oil,"Even the DNA strand follows the Sacred Geometric curve as it rotates around its four elements in endless combinations! This is an unabashed foody with lashings of toffee, butterscotch, cream, butter, and a tidal wave of vanilla. If you like the foodies, this one is a rare beauty. There is also a very, very, very small tot of coffee plopped in for a bit of depth to it all, and that makes it ultra special.

Hubris (The Monkâ€™s Tale) Perfume Oil,"The Monk tells a story of the tragedy which awaits great men at the end of their lives. It is a tale of pride for the most part. The bite and sniff of ginger (the best quality) combine with the cold of flitting winter and a kiss of oncoming spring. There are so many things that could go together here only if there was the will and money to make it happen. Bright and sparkling but lingering and tempting.

Robert Burns-My Love Is Like A Red Red Rose Perfume Oil,"My love is like a red red rose That's newly sprung in June;... ---Robert Burns My Love Is Like A Red Red Rose Few are as outright romantic as Robert Burns in that Highland way. One of the most appealing aspects of his poetry is how fearlessly he veers into an almost limitless passion or backs off to a most tender observation about animals and humanity. In this poem, Burns is lost entirely to his lady love. There should always be a great rose perfume each summer. Art follows Nature. A very comforting, sweet, and almost sugared rose--not sharp at al.

Animal Rampage! Perfume Oil,"You must beware of the animal rampage! Here you find all sorts of strange and wonderful animalics that have the audacity to play with your mind over what is sexy and what is merely background. Blue musk plays a savage dance with some very sweet jasmine which veers into the ""dirty"" category, then comes back massively sensual. A hint of anise recalls a seed mixture, and a bed of black musk keeps it all together.

Portrait of Mrs. Abington (Reynolds) Perfume Oil,Sir Joshua was a relentless experimenter with materials and subject matter. He chose a very popular stage actress known as Mrs. Abington who was not the most beautiful woman but presented in such a winsome manner that we not only feel as if we have met her but that we are charmed by her coyness. Buttery chocolate cake with white frosting and a filling of the best Bavarian cream. Plain and simple a sweet sweet indulgence. Mrs. Abington was said to be a great player of comedy and we think this foody blend would suit her to a tee.,https://possets.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Portrait-of-Mrs-Abington-1-600x600.jpg,Possets,"[""material"", ""subject matter""]",[],[],https://possets.com/product/portrait-of-mrs-abington-reynolds-perfume-oil/
Dandelion Fluff Perfume Oil,"Sharp and succulent, the essence of dandelion mixes with the remnants of the chill lingering in the vernal air (with a nod to a more minty sort of zestiness), a kiss of lemon, a small amount of ambient floral fragrance and you have Dandelion Fluff.

Eve Perfume Oil,"Possets is presenting a slight departure in this perfume. Eve is resplendent with musks, earthy sweetness, lingering and sexy as only that first lady could have been. This is a complex blend, profound even, but still, there is a sparkle to it which marks it as a Posset. The test panel really really loved it before they even put it on, so you know it might just have captured something of the allure of the original Eve! Three Musks, Dragon's Blood, Vetiver, Patchouli, Frankincense, Cocoa. Resinous. In case this is not ringing a bell, The National Geographic Society presented a movie called ""The Journey of Man"" where Dr. Spencer Wells traced the movement of humans across the face of the earth and was able to track where they had been and where many branches of the group departed from one another. He showed that everyone's DNA has traces of one mother, so we can trace ourselves (no matter who we are) to 'mitochondrial Eve,' and this perfume is a tribute to her.",https://possets.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/Eve_le_serpent_et_la_mitochondrie.png,Possets,"[""eve is resplendent"", ""musks"", ""earthy sweetness"", ""lingering"", ""sexy as only that first lady could have been""]",[],[],https://possets.com/product/eve-perfume-oil/
Sterling Swizzle Stick Perfume Oil,"Every lady owned a silver swizzle stick that took excess carbonation out of champagne. After all, the point wasn't to create champagne burps; it was to enjoy the panache of the occasion. A bitter amber plays the champagne role along with a tot of vanilla of the more dry variety, muhuhu adds a definite metallic tang, and it's all finished off with the pink in pink champagne (the lees of the grapes).

Blue Shift Perfume Oil,"As something comes toward you, its color shifts into the blue zone, and this blend mimics that phenomenon. Cooler by far than Red Shift, with the icy edge of violet and mint, Blue Shift manages to be unisex and sexy simultaneously. A note of hydrangea and a small, small amount of sage makes this a lovely combination.

Maharani of Kuch-Bahar Perfume Oil,"She was known for her perfect style. she was impeccable in all things and ineluctable to men. It was said she could seduce a marble statue, a hermit, or a Jesuit and perhaps she proved that she could! The purest of classic thick patchouli, a good dose of blood orange from Sicily, a light brush of incense, thick dark tamarind from India. The fruit somehow lends an animalic edge.

A Lady In Her Own Right Perfume Oil,"When one has their own title which they have inherited from their family and not married into, it is referred to as ""in her own right"". So, if one is allowed the title of Lady, and it was not through marriage, then you are referred to as ""A lady in her own right"". This is considered far finer than to marry into a title. Neroli is one of the most precious flower essences and always denotes a refined sense of taste in scent. Combined with a light kiss of beeswax, and sandalwood to round out things. A drop of myrtle, and a white musk backdrop should round out this splendid perfume which has enough gravitas to pass muster but with a wink to cause trouble.

We used a Mexican vanilla without a woody edge which is very smooth and almost spice laden. We also added a perfect Bulgarian lavender which is full of coumarin, and a hint of saffron (which will make you smile for its stone like edge which somehow makes things sweeter), a very very light rasp of lemon and voila!",https://possets.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/ponder-600x637.jpg,Possets,[],[],[],https://possets.com/product/ponder-perfume-oil/

There is little which is sweeter or more to savor than to allow one of those fine, fine berries fairly melt away on your tongue with the cream of the Gods attending, and washing it all down with good champagne whilst chatting up a good-looking Englishman (or Welshman, or Scot, or Irishman).

Sweet Arabia Perfume Oil,"During the Victorian times, Eastern trade routes flourished. With the advent of faster and more reliable ships things like oude and patchouli, resins and attars could be brought from places like India, China and the Middle East.

A typically Arabian blend with three oudes, ""white"" sandalwood, a hint of charcoal burning (yes, it does have its own very appealing scent), golden copal, and myrrh tears.

To make this blend we took bright starry crystalline musk and cast a foreground of darker more resinous things to enchant: aged patchouli, deep woody vanilla, a goodly jolt of sandalwood, white oude, a pearly clove scent, a fat vanilla, a black vanilla, and natural tonka bean infusion.

Diaphanous Dress Perfume Oil,"If the lovely Primavera would wear a gown, she might be dressed in a garment made of snow crystals and flowers. Even into April, spring can get cold even while the flowers we all love press upward. Spring displays irony in her variability. Deepest and richest Mexican vanilla troupes bravely with the chill aquatic of snow falling in heavy doses and melting almost on contact. A tuft of chlorophyll is in the background and a hint of the flowers it all overtakes for just a while. This is an enchanting fragrance, a hypnotic springtime blend which is more about the atmosphere than the real flowers themselves.",https://possets.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/456px-Portrait_of_a_Lady_in_a_White_Dress_by_William_Merritt_Chase-1.jpg,Possets,"[""even into april"", ""spring can get cold even while the flower we all love press upward""]",[],[],https://possets.com/product/diaphanous-dress-perfume-oil/
Allen Ginsberg-Howl Perfume Oil,"I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness... ---Allen Ginsberg Howl Perhaps the iconic poem of the Beat Generation, Howl needed to be cast as a perfume. By ""cast"" we mean to make a mold of it, as in the lost wax process, so that you can feel the time it portrays with your mind through scent. This was a time of big perfumes, the discovery of patchouli, cigarette smoke, chypre with a wild touch of something from the east. There was sweat and sex, the world was discovered for the first time. Possets' interpretation of Howl is unabashedly sexy, driven mad by welling passions. Black, red and amber musks wrestle furiously with sandalwood and opium tar resin. There is nothing light or gentle about this scent. A burning incense backs it up, black patchouli stands in the forefront. Dark, musky, resinous. Tremendously savage, dark and sweet like molasses rather than sugar. ...and yet, there is something innocent about it all.",https://possets.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Ginsburg-Howl-600x583.jpg,Possets,"[""dark"", ""musky"", ""resinous""]",[],[],https://possets.com/product/allen-ginsberg-howl-perfume-oil/

Very sexy and great for a date night that stretches into a much longer time frame. Please Note: This might cause sensitivity in people who tend to react to cinnamon.

It was one of the most jealously guarded secrets of the Renaissance painters! On to perfume, which has perfect proportions as well! Golden Section is oddly and pleasantly animalic, unaggressively floral, and tempered with three ambers (one honeyed, one dry, and one very sweet and dripping golden).

Jeanne DuVal Mistress of Charles Baudelaire,"Baudelaire was one of the most extreme poets of the 19th century. He wrote a famous book of poetry called Les Fleurs de Mal (Flowers of Evil).

Violet for humility, iris for courage, sandalwood for patience (because it is long-lasting), and finally sweet flag for something which shows its true nature when trodden upon.

Pavane (Faure) Perfume Oil,"The Pavane was a dance performed by nobility long ago. It was usually marked with catty and witty remarks made by and around couples, that feel is caught nicely in the lyrics of this lovely melody. Great jealousy and lust were part of the dance which paraded couples past each other so that romantic wounds could be reopened and hearts rebroken. Here are the lyrics to Faure's Pavane: Itâ€™s Lindor! Itâ€™s Tircis! And all our conquerors! Itâ€™s Myrtil! itâ€™s LydÃ©! The queens of our hearts! How provocative they are, how forever proud! How they dare reign over our destinies and our lives! Watch out! Keep to the measure! O the mortal injury! The cadence is not so slow! And the fall more certain! Weâ€™ll tone down their chatter! Soon weâ€™ll be their lackeys! How ugly they are! Sweet faces! How madcap they are! Coquettish airs! And itâ€™s always the same! And will be so always! They adore one another! They hate one another! They curse their loves! Farewell, Myrtil! EglÃ©! Chloe! Mocking demons! Farewell and good days to the tyrants of our hearts! Silver Cardamom, the sweetest of the strains of cardamom (something nice enough to put in a pasha's coffee) and the exquisite Silver base for which Possets is famous.
