Akragas,"AkragasExtrait de Parfum 100 mlCollection:Classica Black, Tiziana TerenziThis creation was created as a result of the emotional inspiration gained during a long trip to Italy, in search of the scent of salt and its infinite facets.
The Bel Paese is surrounded by the sea, rich in precious salt, and this element has always aided the development of civilisations.
Salt has many facets and is not only obtained from seawater evaporation, but is also extracted from the famous salt pans, which Sicily has in abundance.
Akragas was the ancient name for what is now Agrigento, a very famous city in southern Sicily, known for its enchanting natural beauty and the beautiful Valley of the Temples, a priceless heritage site that has been admired since the days of Magna Graecia and has been impeccably preserved to this day.
The Greek poet Pindar called Agrakas the 'most beautiful city in the world' and this breathtaking beauty is the inspiration for this creation.
In its lengthy history, Agrigento has been influenced by various peoples, from the Magna Graecia to the Carthaginians, from the Arabs to the Normans, bringing together all the cultural facets able to coexist in peace and harmony, offering a beauty that teaches us all.
Akragas seeks to portray the beauty of this crossroads of cultures and wonders through the salt of its most famous quarry, surrounded by Mediterranean scrub and enchanting landscapes.
The creation opens with a pungent bouquet that immediately evokes the Mediterranean maquis, where we perceive Sicilian Myrtle and Mediterranean Seaweed, intensely embraced by the citrus fruits typical of the island, dominated by Royal Grapefruit and the unmistakable persuasiveness of Neroli.
This top note rests on a heart note as strong as the Sicilian land, robust and generous, where Agrigento Salt is the dominant and reverberating note, emphasised by Atlas Cedar, strongly scented by Red Thyme and Bulgarian Geranium.
The entire creation is founded on a powerful and aromatic base, capable of echoing the breezes of the Sicilian sea, thanks to Benzoin driven by Musk, in counterpoint to Singapore Patchouli and Madagascar Vanilla Berries.
The spirit of the wonder of the Agrigento region, in a drop of salty, fascinating perfume.More informationLess informationOlfactory PyramidTop Notes:Sicilian Myrtle, Mediterranean Seaweed, Grapefruit & Sicilian NeroliHeart Notes:Sicilian Salt, Atlas Cedar, Red Thyme & Bulgarian GeraniumBase Notes:Musk, Benzoin, Patchouli from Singapore & Madagascar Vanilla BerriesIngredientsIngredienti/Ingredients: Alcohol Denat., Parfum (Fragrance), Benzyl Salicylate, Coumarin, Hexyl Cinnamal, Citronellol, Linalool, Geraniol, Limonene, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Citral, Benzyl Benzoate, Benzyl Alcohol, Eugenol, Benzyl Cinnamate, Farnesol, Anise AlcoholWarningsFlamable.",https://terenziboutique.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TTPROF_AKR_A-6-600x635.jpg,Tiziana Terenzi,"[""neroli"", ""geranium"", ""grapefruit"", ""cedar"", ""patchouli"", ""benzoin"", ""musk"", ""vanilla"", ""thyme"", ""seaweed""]","[""geranium"", ""cedar"", ""patchouli"", ""benzoin"", ""musk"", ""vanilla"", ""thyme""]","[""patchouli"", ""benzoin"", ""musk"", ""vanilla""]",https://terenziboutique.com/en/product/akragas/

Cielo Blu,"Cielo BluExtrait de Parfum 100 mlCollection:Anniversari Black, Tiziana TerenziCielo Blu was created as a tribute to Marco Polo, the legendary explorer who revealed the secrets of the Orient.
It is a celebration of the 700th anniversary of his death, a vivid reminder of a man who opened up new horizons and brought together distant worlds through his extraordinary adventures.
With his indomitable spirit, Marco Polo showed us that the world is a book and he, a tireless reader, pored over each of its pages with wonder and curiosity.
We are indebted to him for the millions of pieces of knowledge he revealed to us through his adventures, but above all through his skilful mastery as an attentive observer and patient listener to others.
His teaching evokes brotherhood and the inclusion of diversities and contrasts; qualities that belong to special, chosen souls, capable of recognising in other strangers a brother or a sister, because all are children of the same Blue Sky, benevolent creator of so many miracles, today encapsulated in a drop of sky!
Cielo Blu evokes the spirituality of the Great Blue, inspired by the most ancient of Chinese deities, symbolising infinity and a love of boundless space.
This fragrance embodies the harmony between man and creation, a perfect balance between the wild and majestic scents of nature.
The fragrance opens with the sunny brightness of Sicilian Grapefruit and Sorrento Lemon, releasing a citrusy freshness that dances with the vibrant spices of Indian Cardamom.
Tuscan Laurel and Italian Rosemary add a herbaceous note that evokes the scent of the Mediterranean coast.
At the heart of Cielo Blu we find gently blossoming Lake Como Lavender  that lends a floral serenity, while Terenzi Oxygen adds an ethereal, celestial freshness.
Tuscan Acacia and Bulgarian Rose come together in a delicate embrace, a sophisticated bouquet that transports the soul to the enchanted gardens of the Orient.
The base notes offer a robust, enveloping foundation of Chinese Oak Wood, injecting depth and strength.
Indian Ambrette Seeds add a balsamic sweetness, while White Musk envelops the fragrance in a soft, velvety caress, echoing the spiritual connection to the vast Blue Sky.
Cielo Blu tells a story of discoveries and connections, making it an ode to the meeting of East and West.",https://terenziboutique.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/TTPROF_CIE_A-600x635.jpg,Tiziana Terenzi,"[""rose"", ""lemon"", ""grapefruit"", ""cardamom"", ""rosemary"", ""lavender""]","[""rose"", ""lavender""]",[],https://terenziboutique.com/en/product/cielo-blu/

Uxalpha,"UxalphaExtrait de Parfum 100 mlCollection:Tiziana Terenzi, Luna StarUxalpha, another wonder from the Luna collection, came to life on a May night when the pristine skies of Paolo and Tiziana’s hills revealed the secret of a shining star to them.
The Alpha star in the Lynx constellation, the brightest in its celestial realm, shone with the energy of 700 suns, illuminating the darkness with a vibrant, infectious light.
This enchanted experience provided the inspiration to create a fragrance that celebrates the vitality and radiance of souls that never cease to shine.
Uxalpha is an ode to power and brilliance, dedicated to those who radiate light and vitality at all times.
This essence captures the power of the Alpha star, taking the wearer on an olfactory journey that explores the energy and luminosity of the Lynx constellation.
ThLikeits companion Ixbeta, the uniqueness of Uxalpha lies in its ability to blend with other fragrances in the constellation to create unique, inimitable combinations.
When exploring the Lynx constellation, you will have the opportunity to discover the art of intergalactic layering, enjoying the astral fusion of the fragrances it inspired: Lince, Uxalpha, Ixbeta and Lincys.
The top notes of Uxalpha open with a fresh explosion of Calabrian Bergamot, Sicilian Orange and Pink Grapefruit.",https://terenziboutique.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/TTPROF_UXA_A-600x635.jpg,Tiziana Terenzi,"[""bergamot"", ""orange"", ""grapefruit""]","[""labdanum"", ""musk"", ""ambergris"", ""vanilla"", ""caramel"", ""coconut""]","[""ambergris"", ""vanilla"", ""caramel""]",https://terenziboutique.com/en/product/uxalpha/
Iddu,"IdduExtrait de Parfum 100 mlCollection:Tiziana Terenzi, VulcaniThe Iddu creation is dedicated to Stromboli, the island of primordial power, where earth and fire dance in an eternal embrace.
This fragrance captures the indomitable spirit of a wild paradise, suspended between the blue sky and the crystal clear waters of the Mediterranean, a silent witness to the ancient tales of sailors and gods.
At its heart is the passion of a land that never sleeps, evoking the majesty of the volcano, whose presence is as reassuring as it is imposing.
The fragrance is like the warm breath of a breeze whispering secrets dating back thousands of years, carrying with it the echo of myths buried in the depths overflowing with history.
Each spray unfolds a veil of mystery, an invitation to explore the inaccessible, to get lost among the rugged cliffs and black beaches, under a starry sky that seems to defy time.
Iddu is a tribute to the island of Stromboli, a symphony of elements coming together in timeless harmony, a promise of eternity.
We find the composition opening with the enveloping sweetness of Madagascan Vanilla, juxtaposed with the floral freshness of Sicilian Magnolia and the delicate purity of Chinese Lotus.
The generous head sits atop an equally rich and seductive heart, where the regal depth of Ambergris blends with Sicilian Tobacco to create a rich, slightly smoky aroma, while Cambodian Oudh adds a note of exotic and complex wood, reinforcing the fragrance’s unique character.
The base of this seductive creation is intensely robust, enriched by Madagascan Bourbon Vanilla, which enhances the initial sweetness with heightened intensity.
Rounding off the fragrance, Sicilian Birch Moss adds a final touch of earthy, woody elegance, giving Iddu a sensual and enveloping persistence.
Iddu evokes starry nights under the vast sky of Stromboli, capturing the essence of a place suspended between the blue sky and the crystal clear waters of the Mediterranean, a theatre of ancient legends told by sailors and gods.More informationLess informationOlfactory PyramidTop Notes:Madagascan Vanilla, Sicilian Magnolia and Chinese LotusHeart Notes:Ambergris, Sicilian Tobacco and Cambodian OudhBase Notes:Madagascan Bourbon Vanilla, Sicilian Birch MossIngredientsIngredienti/Ingredients: Alcohol Denat., Parfum (Fragrance), Benzyl Benzoate, FarnesolWarningsFlamable.",https://terenziboutique.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/TTPROF_VULIDD_A-600x635.jpg,Tiziana Terenzi,"[""magnolia"", ""birch"", ""ambergris"", ""vanilla"", ""tobacco""]","[""birch"", ""ambergris"", ""vanilla"", ""tobacco""]","[""birch"", ""vanilla""]",https://terenziboutique.com/en/product/iddu/

Torpè,"TorpèExtrait de Parfum 100 mlCollection:Classica Gold, Tiziana TerenziThis creation originates from the memory of a trip to the heart of the French Riviera, between the shimmering blue of the Mediterranean and the hills dotted with olive trees, in Saint-Tropez.
Paolo and Tiziana visited this town with its timeless lifestyle of gentleness and freedom and were inspired by the joyful and vibrant character of this seaside resort.
Saint-Tropez was a fascinating journey through the golden age of life on the Riviera in the 1960s.
In those years, the Italian and French Rivieras were the protagonists of an extraordinary cultural transformation: the life of the all-Italian playboys, known as Les Italiens, who were taking over the Riviera in the 1960s to the cry of “Bare feet, jeans, hair in the wind and go!”
This iconic image perfectly captures the defiant attitude and desire for freedom of the time.
These young people took over the Riviera with a daring spirit and a liberating attitude, embracing a lifestyle of relaxation and fun, while a blazing fire of passion burned within them, driving them to live every moment to its fullest.
When the film ‘And God Created Woman’ hit the big screen, it captured the hearts of audiences around the world thanks to the unforgettable young Brigitte Bardot.
Torpè is a tribute to the timeless glamour of that period, when Saint Tropez became a popular destination for the international jet set.
Torpè, on the other hand, was the name used by the resort’s trendiest ‘rebels’ in the 1960s.
This creation is a fresh, vibrant fragrance whose marine notes remind us of unforgettable summer evenings full of laughter with not a care in the world.
Each note is dedicated to the sea and its magic, a journey of the senses to one of the most fascinating places in the world.
Anyone wearing it can close their eyes and find themselves transported to the cobbled streets of Saint Tropez, amidst the laughter of children at play, the scent of the salty air and the warmth of the sun on their skin.
The fragrance opens with a fresh, citrusy bouquet, thanks to Reggio Calabrian Bergamot, Sorrento Lemon and Sicilian Mandarin, and combines with Marine notes, which add depth to the perfume.
The heart of the fragrance, the true essence of this creation, opens with the muted scents of Bulgarian Rose, Côte d’Azur Lavender, French Iris and Provençal Violet, intertwined with the delicate elegance of Saint Tropez Peony, the sweetness of Sicilian Orange and juicy Romagna Peach.
The entire creation is built on a solid foundation of fine woods such as African Ebony and Australian Sandalwood combined with Musk, Ambergris, Indian Patchouli and Tuscan Oakmoss, creating a beguiling and sensual base that envelops the wearer like a lasting embrace.
Torpè captures the vibrant, lush essence of the Mediterranean coastline.
Its accords are reminiscent of when the turquoise sea meets the sun-kissed olive groves, creating an unforgettable olfactory experience.More informationLess informationOlfactory PyramidTop Notes:Bergamot of Reggio Calabria, Mandarin of Sicily, Lemon of Sorrento, Marine NotesHeart Notes:Bulgarian Rose, French Riviera Lavender, French Iris, Provence Violet, Saint Tropez Peony, Sicilian Orange Blossom, Romagna PeachBase Notes:Ambergris, Musk, African Ebony, Australian Sandalwood, Indian Patchouli, Tuscan OakmossIngredientsIngredienti/Ingredients: Alcohol Denat., Parfum (Fragrance), Limonene, Linalool, Citronellol, Geraniol, Citral, Hydroxycitronellal, Eugenol, Amyl CinnamalWarningsFlamable.",https://terenziboutique.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/TTPROF_TOR_A-600x635.jpg,Tiziana Terenzi,"[""rose"", ""iris"", ""violet"", ""peony"", ""orange blossom"", ""bergamot"", ""lemon"", ""orange"", ""mandarin"", ""sandalwood"", ""patchouli"", ""ebony"", ""musk"", ""ambergris"", ""peach"", ""lavender"", ""marine""]","[""rose"", ""iris"", ""violet"", ""peony"", ""orange blossom"", ""orange"", ""sandalwood"", ""patchouli"", ""ebony"", ""musk"", ""ambergris"", ""peach"", ""lavender""]","[""sandalwood"", ""patchouli"", ""ebony"", ""musk"", ""ambergris""]",https://terenziboutique.com/en/product/torpe/

Again on a quest for style, which began with the dreamlike journey towards the constellations and then the stars connected to them, here the olfactory pyramid of Cassiopea is again broken down and reformulated in an innovative, unique creation, capable of pushing itself beyond the furthest stylistic frontiers we know.
A trip along the tightrope, in hot pursuit of the emotional vertigo unleashed by the hypnotic opulence of White Iris, lashed sharply by the fresh citrus notes of bergamot, but immediately contrasted by the bold, concerted action of pink Pepper and ginger.

Hyakutake,"HyakutakeExtrait de Parfum 100 mlCollection:Tiziana Terenzi, CometTiziana and Paolo’s intergalactic journey to discover the celestial emotions produced by
magical stellar fires continues.
Stars, in fact, are luminous fires that shine in the celestial vault, lighting up our nights.
Comets boast a distinctive, legendary charm, with their light able to bring gifts of joy, hope and
good fortune to mankind and those who have eyes to see them.
The creation is inspired by the world-famous Comet Hyakutake, which passed close to earth
on its endless journey in January 1996.
Known for its long, very bright tail, it was discovered by a Japanese amateur astronomer, Yuji
Hyakutake, sparking great astonishment in the scientific community.
Just like this fragrance dedicated to it, full of mystery and charm, it is capable of revealing itself
to pure eyes only, those able to look where most cannot see.
In the darkness of the deepest night, a powerful light pierced the sky on that cold January day,
and now this perfume warms the heart of whoever wears it, giving them an aura of mystery
and wild charm.
Hyakutake opens with a ‘hesperidian’ accord dominated by the effervescence of Sorrento
Lemon and Reggio Calabrian Bergamot, enriched by the spicy aromas of highly sophisticated
Malabar Cardamom and the balsamic reverberations of Greek Eucalyptus.
The head folds gently into an embrace given by the heart of the creation, where the delicacy of
Italian Wild Pansy and the strength of Tuscan Orris blend with the persuasive combination of
Ambergris and Omani Incense.
The base is characterised by an acrobatic balance of woods, where the trilogy of Japanese Larch,
Australian Sandalwood and African Iroko reverberate powerfully, softened and emphasised
by the scent of Virginian Tobacco and Haitian Vetiver.
This creation is imbued with mystery and seductive elegance, capable of ravishing and
bewitching, seducing and conquering, but above all capable of warming hearts with the joy
of its stately, timeless aroma, because its irresistible charm is suspended in the timeline, just
like travelling comets floating in the celestial sphere.More informationLess informationOlfactory PyramidTop Notes:Sorrento Lemon,

The craftsmanship of Paolo and Tiziana Terenzi is evident in the way the perfume evolves on the skin, at times a warm, enveloping embrace, at others a cool breeze reminiscent of early morning on the rocky slopes.
The creation encapsulates a piece of land scorched by the sun and enriched by history.
O’ Vesù appeals to those who dare to approach fire without fear of being consumed, to those who wish to carry with them the echo of a powerful and ever-changing land.
The design of the bottle itself is a tribute to the beauty of Vesuvius, with lines that evoke its majesty and grandeur, and a cap texture that seems to capture the hardness and darkness of the volcano’s ash.
It is a collector’s item, as precious as the fragrance it contains.
The creation opens with citrus notes, with Neapolitan Grapefruit shining through thanks to its vibrant citrus acidity.
Alongside, Peruvian Pink Pepper dances with a spicy and slightly sweet touch, while Amalfi Rhubarb adds an unusual, almost crystalline acidic freshness that teases the senses in a delicious prelude.
This captivating head rests on an opulent, sweet heart.
Indian Jasmine Petals unfurl their opulent floral sweetness to weave a ribbon of fragrance that envelops and seduces.
Italian Leather introduces a rich, earthy texture that evokes craftsmanship and tradition, while Ambergris adds a mysterious, deep warmth.
Finally, Vesuvius Lava Stone carries with it a primordial force, a fiery reminder of its wild, volcanic origins.
The strength of this creation is built on a very structured foundation.",https://terenziboutique.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/TTPROF_VULOVE_A-600x635.jpg,Tiziana Terenzi,"[""jasmine"", ""grapefruit"", ""sandalwood"", ""cedar"", ""vetiver"", ""birch"", ""pepper"", ""pink pepper"", ""ambergris"", ""leather""]","[""jasmine"", ""sandalwood"", ""cedar"", ""vetiver"", ""birch"", ""ambergris"", ""leather""]","[""sandalwood"", ""cedar"", ""vetiver"", ""birch""]",https://terenziboutique.com/en/product/ovesu/

Hao,"HaoExtrait de Parfum 100 mlCollection:Anniversari Gold, Tiziana TerenziHao is a poetic tribute to eternal love, a delicate and poignant commemoration of the 700th anniversary of Marco Polo’s death.
This fragrance tells  the mysterious legend of a love born within the ancient walls of Imperial China, where destiny intertwined the lives of Marco Polo and the sweet Hao Dong, daughter of Emperor Kublai Khan and granddaughter of the feared Genghis Khan.
The story chronicles a magical encounter, a case of love at first sight that occurred when, on hearing Hao’s melodious voice as she sang from the balcony, Marco was enraptured by a passion that left a lasting mark on his heart.
With her ethereal beauty and enigmatic charm, Hao Dong became the love of Marco Polo’s life.
Their strong, deep bond led them to live together in the court of Kublai Khan, joining together two distant worlds.
Hao followed Marco when he returned to Venice, leaving behind her homeland forever.
But their love story came up against misunderstanding and prejudice in the Italian city.
Hao could only find solace in her voice, singing softly to evoke memories of her beloved land.
To this day, their love remains shrouded in mystery, a bridge between two cultures and a testament to a bond that stood the test of time.
Hao opens with bright, delicate notes, Sicilian Orange Blossom lends a citrusy freshness, Chinese Lotus Flower evokes the serenity of oriental lakes, while Florentine Iris adds a touch of elegance and mystery.
In the heart of the fragrance, Australian Sandalwood and Madagascar Vanilla blend in a warm and enveloping embrace.",https://terenziboutique.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/TTPROF_HAO_A-600x635.jpg,Tiziana Terenzi,"[""orange blossom"", ""orange"", ""sandalwood"", ""musk"", ""ambergris"", ""vanilla"", ""caramel""]","[""sandalwood"", ""musk"", ""ambergris"", ""vanilla"", ""caramel""]","[""musk""]",https://terenziboutique.com/en/product/hao/

Rivèa,"RivèaExtrait de Parfum 100 mlCollection:Classica Black, Tiziana TerenziOn a trip to the Ligurian Riviera, Paolo and Tiziana were inspired by a place of natural beauty that combines the elegance and uniqueness of Italian style: Portofino.
Strolling along the shores of this magnificent village, remembering the energy and magic of the dancing flames of the San Giorgio bonfire and thinking back to their childhood memories and the sea, which had always been a fundamental element in the most important moments of their lives and an endless source of inspiration for creativity, the idea for a new perfume was born.
The Terenzi siblings were fascinated by one of the most recognisable features of Portofino: its crescent-shaped bay, framed by green hills that offer awe-inspiring views and a spectacle of beauty that takes your breath away.
The Riviera of the 1960s was characterised by the elegance of the Italian dolce vita and the life of the all-Italian playboys, known as Les Italiens, who were taking over the Riviera at that time to the cry of “Bare feet, jeans, hair in the wind and go!”
The picturesque bays and golden beaches became places where you could live out the dream of la dolce vita.",https://terenziboutique.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/TTPROF_RIV_A-600x635.jpg,Tiziana Terenzi,"[""rose"", ""lemon"", ""saffron""]","[""sandalwood"", ""vetiver"", ""patchouli"", ""cypress"", ""ambergris"", ""seaweed""]","[""sandalwood"", ""cypress"", ""ambergris""]",https://terenziboutique.com/en/product/rivea/
Ixbeta,"IxbetaExtrait de Parfum 100 mlCollection:Tiziana Terenzi, Luna StarIxbeta was born on a night of magic and wonder under a crystal clear May sky.
On that enchanted evening, Paolo and Tiziana looked out over the flower-filled hills of their land, lost in the silent dance of the Lynx constellation.
The star Beta shone with unexpected strength in a dark region of the sky, where stars are shy and rare..
This celestial spectacle inspired the two siblings to create Ixbeta, a fragrance that embodies the brightness and tenacity of a star struggling to shine in the darkness of the night.
Ixbeta is a tribute to those who never give up, to those who find their inner light even in the blackest darkness.
Like the star Beta in the Lynx constellation, this fragrance shines with intensity and determination.
It is an invitation to explore new olfactory combinations: Ixbeta can be combined with other Lynx constellation fragrances to create even more fascinating, surprising symphonies of light.
Journey to the Lynx constellation and you will discover the art of intergalactic layering through the stellar alchemy of perfumes inspired by the constellation: Lince, Uxalpha, Ixbeta and Lincys.

Abbrivio,"AbbrivioEXTRAIT DE PARFUM LINEA TT 100 ML ABBRIVIOCollection:Tiziana Terenzi, Sea StarsIn the nautical world, the Italian word ‘abbrivio’ means headway and refers to the inertial motion of a boat.
When a boat starts to move, in fact, its thrusters have to overcome an immense inertia, generated by the weight and shape of the boat itself, immersed in the water.
Let us imagine Telea’s unfurled sails swelling to pull the mast fixed to its deck forward, thanks to the sheer power of the wind, but in moments that sometimes seem eternal, nothing happens and the boat remains motionless; then suddenly and with a momentum of its own, not governed by man, the boat generates motion.
This thrust is the headway: difficult to get going, but then almost unstoppable.
There are two types of headway, increasing and decreasing, both of which are daughters of the same mother and which a good sailor must come to terms with in order to sail safely.
The headway is a magic trick of motion that has always fascinated seafarers because of its beauty that is not fully revealed and is ever changing and fickle depending on the weather conditions.
Every boat has its own soul and therefore its own headway, which can never be the same as any other.
A kind of inimitable, unique fingerprint, just as the creation inspired by it is inimitable and unique.
This magical and unpredictable, mysterious and inexplicable force is fully encapsulated in the Starfish Collection bottle.
Just like the force of the unstoppable headway that can only be controlled by expert hands, this creation can be discovered by profound connoisseurs of the art of perfumery.
Abbrivio opens with a fresh, frothy, fruity bouquet, thanks to the scent of Brazilian Orange with Dolomite Blackcurrant and Romagna Strawberry, emphasised by the aromatic hint of Mediterranean Santolina.
The unpredictable and evolving head settles into an even more trembling and untamed heart where, from the outset, the seductive force of Ambergris is felt, combined with the contrast of Coumarin and Adriatic Seaweed, softened by the persuasiveness of Amazonian Tonka Bean and Cuban Cane Sugar.
The base of this mysterious creation is firmly rooted in the strong notes of Atlas Cedar and Singapore Patchouli, strengthened by the regal presence of Tuscan Oak and Australian Sandalwood, then emphasised by the persuasive combination of Romagna Oak Moss and Musk.
Abbrivio encapsulates the mysterious force of motion generated by obscure forces that reverberate in the lapping water like magical effluvia capable of seducing and bewitching, for those who are not afraid to venture into the coral blue of life.More informationLess informationOlfactory PyramidTop Notes:Brazilian Orange, Dolomite Blackcurrant, Mediterranean Santolina and Romagna StrawberryHeart Notes:Ambergris, Coumarin, Adriatic Seaweed, Amazonian Tonka Bean and Cuban Cane SugarBase Notes:Singapore Patchouli, Atlas Cedar, Tuscan Oak, Australian Sandalwood, Romagna Oak Moss and MuskIngredientsIngredienti/Ingredients: Alcohol Denat., Parfum (Fragrance), Limonene, Coumarin, Geraniol, Hydroxycitronellal, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Farnesol, Citral, Citronellol, Anise Alcohol, LinaloolWarningsFlamable.",https://terenziboutique.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/TTPROF_ABB_A-1-600x635.jpg,Tiziana Terenzi,"[""orange"", ""sandalwood"", ""cedar"", ""patchouli"", ""ambergris"", ""tonka bean"", ""sugar"", ""strawberry"", ""moss"", ""seaweed""]","[""sandalwood"", ""cedar"", ""patchouli"", ""ambergris"", ""tonka bean"", ""sugar"", ""moss"", ""seaweed""]","[""sandalwood"", ""cedar"", ""patchouli"", ""moss""]",https://terenziboutique.com/en/product/abbrivio/

Struo’,"Struo’Extrait de Parfum 100 mlCollection:Tiziana Terenzi, VulcaniIn the sublime realm of fragrances, where the art of perfumery rises as a divine sculptor of atmospheres, an incomparable olfactory creation has been born, christened Struò and dedicated to the Volcano.
This fragrance is a fiery homage to the majestic telluric power that resides in the beating heart of the earth, a tribute to those smoking peaks that rise imperiously into the clear sky.
Struò, shrouded in mystery like the dense clouds of ash that dance around the smoking crater, evokes the indomitable spirit of an earth that burns in perpetual renewal.
Its aura is an invitation to contemplate the eternal cycle of destruction and creation, a cycle that pulsates in the glowing heart of the world.
The sensations that ensue from encountering these olfactory notes are comparable to the experience of observing the seething magma pouring forth with unbridled fervour from the bowels of the earth.
There is a sense of sublime terror and admiration, a tension between reverent awe and attraction to the infinite power of the Volcano.
I therefore invite the most ardent fans of the olfactory world to immerse themselves in this unique sensory experience, where strength and beauty coexist in a dance of elements that only the art of artistic perfumery can translate into a symphony for the sense of smell.
With this creation, the mystery and magnificence of the Volcano come to life in a tangible form, enveloping the being in a cloak of enigmatic splendour.
Struò opens with a ‘hesperidian’ accord dominated by the effervescence of Calabrian Bergamot and Sicilian Mandarin blending with the depth and complexity of Sicilian Saffron.
The head gently folds into an embrace from the heart of creation, where Lebanese Cedar emerges with its robustness, perfectly balanced by Sri Lankan Green Tea, which introduces a gentle, purifying freshness.Indian Cloves and Himalayan Cardamom enrich the heart with their exotic, penetrating spices, while Cambodian Oudh weaves a rich, mysterious aroma that invites contemplation.

Vittoriale,"VittorialeExtrait de Parfum 100 mlCollection:Anniversari Black, Tiziana TerenziThe Vittoriale degli Italiani is one of the most evocative places in the world, almost a city within a city, a verdant and scenic space on Lake Garda, created by the genius of the great writer Gabriele D'Annunzio .
It is made up of many spaces: the park, the amphitheatre and many rooms inside the huge villa where relics, mementos, memorabilia and traces of his 'extravagant' lifestyle are kept.
The poet-soldier's goal was to make the place a kind of memorial to his 'inimitable life.'
The fragrance narrates these spaces where everything is unusual and mystical: in particular, our attention is drawn to the Music Room, where every detail is imbued with an unsettling sensuality.
From the very first moment, the fragrance immerses us in a surreal atmosphere, generated by a special play of contrasts, where Cardamom Seeds and the decisive scent of Italian Leather intertwine and chase each other with the decisive essence of Peat and Tobacco, like the rush of a vertigo that quickly becomes mysterious and exotic, thanks to the Jasmine Flowers and Garda Violet, narrating the precious drapes of blood red and black silk that adorn the walls of the room.
The perturbing brutal notes, emphasised by Laudanum and precious Musk, accompany us in the visual and dreamlike tale through the precious fabrics, embroidered in gold with wild and majestic beasts, tamed by the song and music vibrating in the room.
The untamed power of Patchouli continues to narrate an inexhaustible desire to live outside all convention, following only the refined aesthetic quest for wonder.

Verna,"VernaExtrait de Parfum 100 mlCollection:Luna Special, Tiziana TerenziThere is a village hidden between the Ligurian sea and mountains that has been sculpted by time and shaped by the wind: Vernazza, one of the Cinque Terra’s most precious gems.
Here, in a place where the waves break gently on the rocks, and the colourful houses are reflected in the crystal-clear water, each corner has a story to tell about a past that still resides in those that live there.
In this place full of charm, under the silent shadow of the Black Moon, Paolo and Tiziana found themselves surrounded by a mysterious, spellbinding aura.
This is the place where inspiration for Verna came to life, an olfactory tribute that contains the most authentic soul of this timeless village.
The Black Moon, a symbol of rebirth and the search for new horizons, appears when the sky turns pitch black and the moon dissolves into a shadowy ring.
During a summer stroll in Vernazza, while the village was settling into the peaceful evening, Paolo and Tiziana stopped off in the square by the harbour, where the scent of the sea was merging with that of the land, and where every alleyway seemed to hold an ancient secret.
The wind, overflowing with stories and traditions, was blowing like a prophesy, guiding brother and sister towards a new creation.
This is how Verna was born, like a tribute to the strength of new beginnings, celebrating the authentic essence of Vernazza and the transformative energy of the Black Moon.
Verna opens with the spicy, luminous notes that conjure up the lively nature of the village.",https://terenziboutique.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/TTPROF_VER_A-1-600x635.jpg,Tiziana Terenzi,"[""rose"", ""jasmine"", ""tuberose"", ""pepper"", ""pink pepper"", ""saffron"", ""musk"", ""ambergris"", ""leather"", ""vanilla"", ""coconut"", ""peach""]","[""jasmine"", ""tuberose"", ""musk"", ""ambergris"", ""leather"", ""vanilla"", ""coconut"", ""peach""]","[""musk"", ""ambergris"", ""vanilla""]",https://terenziboutique.com/en/product/verna/

Smeralda,"SmeraldaExtrait de Parfum 100 mlCollection:Luna Special, Tiziana TerenziAmidst the endless blue skies and bright green waters of Sardinia, there is a place that enchants every single person that sets foot there.
It is the Emerald Coast, a stretch of land that has been sculpted by the wind and sea, where wild nature intertwines with timeless elegance.
This unique scenario is where the Mediterranean’s allure is evident in its purest form.
It is the enigmatic gaze of the Red Moon, the magical moon that fills the sky with scarlet hues each month, that offered Paolo and Tiziana the inspiration to create a new pearl for their Luna Special collection: Smeralda.
The Red Moon, a symbol of mystery and power, guiding dreams and spells, just like waves guide the sea.
While spending a summer’s evening on a hidden beach of the Emerald Coast, brother and sister were enraptured by a sunset that could have been sculpted by the universe.
The water glinted with emerald hues, dancing to the rhythm of the waves, while the air was filled with the enveloping scent of the Mediterranean scrub.
At nightfall, as the moon turned red and the place vibrated with a unique magic, the idea of transforming that very landscape into a fragrance  that could contain the eternal essence of this coast and its timeless beauty took shape.
Smeralda opens with a sparkling freshness that conjures up the first breath of sea air.",https://terenziboutique.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/TTPROF_SME_A-1-600x635.jpg,Tiziana Terenzi,"[""rose"", ""iris"", ""grapefruit"", ""mandarin"", ""sandalwood"", ""vetiver"", ""patchouli"", ""cinnamon"", ""ginger"", ""pepper"", ""black pepper"", ""labdanum"", ""ambergris"", ""leather"", ""vanilla"", ""mint"", ""leaves"", ""tobacco""]","[""rose"", ""iris"", ""sandalwood"", ""vetiver"", ""patchouli"", ""cinnamon"", ""labdanum"", ""ambergris"", ""leather"", ""vanilla"", ""leaves"", ""tobacco""]",[],https://terenziboutique.com/en/product/smeralda/
