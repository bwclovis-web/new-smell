# Do Not Delete Any Data

**Hard constraint:** Do not delete any data in this project.

- Do not suggest or implement changes that delete rows, truncate tables, or drop columns that remove stored data.
- Do not run or suggest migrations that drop data (e.g. dropping a column with data, truncating tables).
- Do not clear or overwrite user content without explicit backup or safety (e.g. user preferences, profiles, reviews, collections).
- Safe operations are fine: adding columns, new tables, regenerating code (e.g. `prisma generate`), and changing UI/logic that only affects how existing data is displayed or updated.

When in doubt, prefer additive or backward-compatible changes over removing or dropping data.
