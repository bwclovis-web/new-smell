One last goodbye. The air is thick with unspoken words, a sultry haze wraps around the memory of a lost love. Lychee dances on the edge of nostalgia, tantalizing and dangerous, like a fleeting glance from across a dimly lit room. Coconut murmurs of sun-kissed days gone by, while vanilla's warm embrace lingers like a lover’s touch, igniting a desire that refuses to fade. White musk and vetiver ground the moment, their earthy depths evoking the shadows of a forgotten promise. In the stillness of the night, the echoes of that farewell haunt the air, leaving behind an intoxicating allure that beckons the heart to remember, to yearn, to lose itself once more.
