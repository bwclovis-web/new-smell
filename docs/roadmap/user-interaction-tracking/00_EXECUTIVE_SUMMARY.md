# Executive Summary: User Interaction Data Collection for AI

**Document Type:** Executive Summary  
**Date:** November 1, 2025  
**Status:** Approved for Planning  
**Priority:** CRITICAL

---

## Overview

This executive summary provides a high-level overview of our strategy to collect and structure user interaction data to power AI-driven features on the New Smell perfume trading platform, particularly the Intelligent Perfume Recommendation Engine.

## The Problem

Currently, the New Smell platform captures basic user data (ratings, reviews, wishlists, collections) but **lacks comprehensive interaction tracking** needed to:

- Provide personalized perfume recommendations
- Optimize search and discovery
- Predict user behavior and preferences
- Improve user engagement and retention

**Gap:** We're missing 60-70% of valuable interaction data including page views, search patterns, engagement metrics, and behavioral signals.

## The Solution

Implement a comprehensive user interaction tracking system that captures:

1. **Explicit Interactions** (High Signal)

   - Ratings, reviews, wishlist additions
   - Collection management, trade offers
   - Clear preference indicators

2. **Implicit Interactions** (Medium Signal)

   - Page views, search queries
   - Filter usage, navigation patterns
   - Browsing behavior

3. **Negative Signals** (Critical for Filtering)

   - Quick exits, wishlist removals
   - Low ratings, hidden items
   - Prevents bad recommendations

4. **Contextual Signals**
   - Device type, time of day
   - Session patterns, referrer data
   - Environmental context
