# Prisma Optimization for Large Response Prevention

## Problem

The application was encountering a Prisma error:

```
PrismaClientKnownRequestError: The response size of the query exceeded the maximum of 5MB with 5.99MB
```

This occurred when calling `prisma.perfumeHouse.findMany()` without any limits or field selection, causing the response to exceed Prisma's 5MB limit.

## Solution

Implemented pagination and field selection to reduce response sizes:

### 1. Updated `getAllHousesWithOptions` function

- Added `skip`, `take`, and `selectFields` parameters
- When `selectFields: true`, only returns essential fields:
  - `id`, `name`, `type`, `country`, `founded`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
  - Excludes large fields: `description`, `image`, `website`, `email`, `phone`, `address`

### 2. New `getHousesPaginated` function

- Returns paginated results with metadata:
  - `houses`: Array of perfume houses
  - `count`: Total number of houses
  - `hasMore`: Boolean indicating if more results exist
  - `currentPage`: Current page number
  - `totalPages`: Total number of pages

### 3. Updated `getAllHouses` function

- Added pagination support with `skip`, `take`, and `selectFields` parameters
- Maintains backward compatibility

## Usage Examples

### Basic pagination with field selection:

```typescript
const result = await getHousesPaginated({
  skip: 0,
  take: 50,
  selectFields: true,
  sortBy: "name-asc",
});
```

### Get all houses with essential fields only:

```typescript
const houses = await getAllHouses({
  selectFields: true,
  take: 1000,
});
```

### Sort houses with pagination:

```typescript
const result = await getAllHousesWithOptions({
  sortBy: "name-asc",
  skip: 0,
  take: 100,
  selectFields: true,
});
```

## Updated Routes

The following routes have been updated to use the optimized functions:

1. **`/api/houseSortLoader`** - Now uses `getHousesPaginated` with pagination
2. **`/api/data-quality-houses`** - Uses `getAllHouses` with field selection
3. **`/admin/create-perfume`** - Uses `getAllHouses` with field selection
4. **`/admin/edit-perfume`** - Uses `getAllHouses` with field selection
5. **`/api/data-quality`** - Uses direct Prisma query with field selection
6. **`/home`** - Uses optimized `getAllFeatures` function

## Benefits

- **Prevents 5MB response size errors**
- **Improved performance** with smaller data transfers
- **Better scalability** as database grows
- **Maintains functionality** while reducing resource usage
- **Backward compatibility** for existing code

## Migration Notes

- Existing code will continue to work
- New pagination parameters are optional
- Use `selectFields: true` when you only need essential house information
- Implement pagination in UI components for better user experience

## Future Considerations

- Consider implementing infinite scroll or pagination controls in the UI
- Monitor response sizes as the database grows
- Add caching for frequently accessed house data
- Consider implementing search functionality to reduce the need for large queries
