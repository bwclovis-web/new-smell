# Perfume Database Data Quality Recommendations

## Summary of Findings

After analyzing the perfume database, we've identified two major data quality issues:

1. **Missing Information**: 246 perfume entries are missing either descriptions, notes, or both
2. **Duplicate Entries**: 37 perfumes have duplicate entries across the database

## Recommendations for Data Cleanup

### Missing Information

1. **Prioritize by Brand**: Focus first on brands with the most missing data:

   - Shopsorce (69 entries)
   - 4160 Tuesdays (52 entries)
   - Poesie Perfume (50 entries)

2. **Focus on Popular Perfumes**: Within each brand, prioritize fixing missing information for the most popular or flagship perfumes.

3. **Automate Data Collection**: Consider using the existing scrapers to re-scrape missing information or developing new scrapers for brands with the most missing data.

4. **Create a Data Enrichment Process**: Establish a systematic approach to filling in missing descriptions and notes by:
   - Contacting brands directly for official information
   - Using reliable third-party sources like Fragrantica or Basenotes
   - Developing custom scrapers for brands with unique webpage structures
   - Setting up a schedule for periodic data quality checks

### Duplicate Entries

1. **Fix Xerjoff Data**: The Xerjoff CSV file has 34 perfumes with duplicate entries. These need to be merged or deduplicated.

2. **Fix Navitus Data**: The Navitus CSV file has 3 perfumes with duplicate entries.

3. **Implement Deduplication Strategy**:

   - For entries with identical information, simply remove duplicates
   - For entries with complementary information (one has notes, one has description), merge the entries
   - For entries with conflicting information, establish a source of truth and choose the most accurate data

4. **Prevent Future Duplicates**: Modify import scripts to check for existing entries before adding new ones.

## Technical Implementation Plan

1. **Create Data Quality Dashboard**:

   - Use the scripts we've developed to regularly generate reports
   - Track progress on fixing missing information and duplicates
   - Access the interactive dashboard at `/admin/data-quality`
   - Run the report generation script periodically: `node scripts/generate_data_quality_reports.js`
   - Monitor trends over time to ensure data quality improves

2. **Enhance Import Process**:

   - Modify `import_perfumes.js` to detect and handle duplicates
   - Add validation for required fields
   - Implement warnings for potential data quality issues

3. **Database Schema Improvements**:

   - Consider adding unique constraints for perfume name + brand combinations
   - Add metadata fields to track data quality and source

4. **Develop Merging Tools**:
   - Create tools to help merge duplicate entries with different information
   - Implement batch processes for data cleanup

## Next Steps

1. Create a Jira/GitHub issue for each brand with missing information
2. âœ… Fix the Xerjoff scraper to address missing descriptions and notes (completed)
3. Fix the remaining Xerjoff duplicates (they appear to have the most duplicates)
4. Update the data import pipeline to prevent future duplicates
5. Schedule regular data quality checks using the analysis scripts
