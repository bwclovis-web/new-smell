# Code Refactoring Summary

## Overview

Successfully extracted duplicate code between `behind-the-bottle.tsx` and `the-vault.tsx` into reusable components and hooks, significantly reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.

## What Was Extracted

### 1. Shared Component: `DataDisplaySection`

- **Location**: `app/components/Organisms/DataDisplaySection/DataDisplaySection.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Handles the display of data items (houses/perfumes) with infinite scroll functionality
- **Features**:
  - Grid layout for items
  - Loading states
  - Infinite scroll observer
  - Load more button
  - Empty state message
  - Generic enough to work with both houses and perfumes

### 2. Shared Hook: `useDataByLetter`

- **Location**: `app/hooks/useDataByLetter.ts`
- **Purpose**: Generic data fetching hook for letter-based pagination
- **Features**:
  - Configurable endpoint
  - Error handling
  - Loading states
  - Generic typing for different data types

### 3. Shared Hook: `useLetterSelection`

- **Location**: `app/hooks/useLetterSelection.ts`
- **Purpose**: Handles letter selection logic and data loading
- **Features**:
  - Letter selection/deselection
  - Integration with infinite scroll reset
  - Generic data loading callback

## Benefits of Refactoring

### Code Reduction

- **Before**: ~200 lines in each file with significant duplication
- **After**: ~100 lines in each file with shared logic extracted
- **Total reduction**: ~200 lines of duplicate code eliminated

### Maintainability

- Single source of truth for data display logic
- Easier to update infinite scroll behavior
- Consistent UI patterns across pages
- Centralized error handling

### Reusability

- Components can be easily used for other letter-based data displays
- Hooks are generic and can work with different data types
- Consistent API across different implementations

### Type Safety

- Generic typing for different data types
- Better TypeScript support
- Reduced chance of runtime errors

## Files Modified

### New Files Created

1. `app/components/Organisms/DataDisplaySection/DataDisplaySection.tsx`
2. `app/components/Organisms/DataDisplaySection/index.ts`
3. `app/hooks/useDataByLetter.ts`
4. `app/hooks/useLetterSelection.ts`
5. `app/hooks/index.ts`

### Files Refactored

1. `app/routes/behind-the-bottle.tsx` - Now uses shared components
2. `app/routes/the-vault.tsx` - Now uses shared components

## Usage Example

```tsx
// Before: Duplicate code in each file
const handleLetterClick = async (letter: string | null) => {
  // 20+ lines of duplicate logic
}

// After: Clean, reusable hook
const { selectedLetter, handleLetterClick } = useLetterSelection({
  loadDataByLetter: data.loadDataByLetter,
  resetData: resetHouses,
})
```

## Next Steps

1. **Fix remaining linter errors** - Some TypeScript type issues need resolution
2. **Add tests** - Unit tests for the new shared components and hooks
3. **Documentation** - Add JSDoc comments for better developer experience
4. **Performance optimization** - Consider memoization for expensive operations
5. **Accessibility** - Ensure ARIA attributes are properly implemented

## Impact

This refactoring significantly improves the codebase by:

- Eliminating ~200 lines of duplicate code
- Creating reusable, maintainable components
- Improving consistency across similar pages
- Making future changes easier to implement
- Providing a foundation for other letter-based data displays
