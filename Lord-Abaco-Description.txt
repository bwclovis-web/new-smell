Shadows emerge from the depths of an abandoned harbor, where 'Lord-Abaco' lingers like a secret whispered in the night. Smoky bergamot and black pepper evoke a thrill of danger, while rich leather and cedarwood unfold, reminiscent of a sultry figure draped in velvet. Deep amber and tonka bean leave a trail of intrigue, inviting you into a world where every breath tells a tale of passion and peril.
