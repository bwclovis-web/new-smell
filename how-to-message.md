# How to Message Other Users

## Overview

The messaging feature allows you to send direct messages to other users on the platform. Messages are integrated into your Alerts section and you'll receive notifications when you have new messages.

## Accessing Messages

### From Your Profile Page
1. Navigate to your **Profile** page (Admin section)
2. Scroll to the **Alerts** section
3. You'll see a **Messages** section below your alerts
4. Click on any conversation to view and send messages

### From Navigation
- Look for the message notification badge in the top navigation bar
- The badge shows the number of unread messages you have
- Click the badge to quickly access your messages

## Starting a Conversation

### Who Can You Message?
You can only message users who have items in **The Vault** (users who have listed perfumes available for trade or decanting). Similarly, other users can only message you if you have items in The Vault.

### How to Start Messaging
1. Find a user you want to message (e.g., from The Exchange or a trader profile)
2. If both you and the other user have items in The Vault, you'll be able to start a conversation
3. The conversation will appear in your Messages section automatically when you send your first message

## Sending Messages

1. Open a conversation from your Messages list
2. Type your message in the message input field at the bottom
3. Press **Enter** or click **Send** to send your message
4. Messages appear in chronological order with the most recent at the bottom
5. The conversation automatically scrolls to show the latest messages

## Reading Messages

- **Unread Indicator**: Conversations with unread messages are highlighted
- **Read Status**: Messages are automatically marked as read when you view the conversation
- **Unread Count**: The number next to each conversation shows how many unread messages you have in that conversation

## Notifications

### Notification Badge
- A badge in the top navigation shows your total unread message count
- The badge updates automatically every 30-60 seconds
- Click the badge to go directly to your messages

### Real-Time Updates
- Messages are checked for updates every 30-60 seconds
- You don't need to refresh the page to see new messages
- The unread count updates automatically

## Message Features

### Conversation List
- See all your active conversations
- Each conversation shows:
  - The other user's name
  - A preview of the last message
  - The timestamp of the last message
  - Unread message count (if any)

### Message View
- View the full conversation history
- See who sent each message and when
- Send new messages in the same view
- Messages are displayed in chronological order

## Restrictions

### Vault Item Requirement
- **You must have items in The Vault** to message other users
- **The other user must also have items in The Vault** for you to message them
- This ensures messaging is only available between active traders/users with items to exchange

### What Counts as "Items in The Vault"?
- Perfumes you've added to your collection with `available` amount greater than 0
- Items listed in The Exchange
- Your personal perfume inventory that's available for trade or decanting

## Tips

1. **Check Your Vault**: Make sure you have items listed in The Vault before trying to message someone
2. **Be Patient**: Messages update every 30-60 seconds, so new messages may take a moment to appear
3. **Stay Organized**: Keep track of your conversations through the Messages section in your profile
4. **Respectful Communication**: Use messaging to discuss trades, ask questions about items, or coordinate exchanges

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Message Someone?
- **Check if you have items in The Vault**: You need at least one perfume with `available > 0`
- **Check if they have items in The Vault**: The other user must also have items available
- **Verify you're logged in**: Make sure you're signed in to your account

### Not Seeing New Messages?
- Messages update automatically every 30-60 seconds
- Try refreshing the page if you've been waiting longer
- Check that you're viewing the correct conversation

### Messages Not Sending?
- Verify you have an active internet connection
- Make sure you're still logged in
- Check that the conversation is still active (the other user hasn't been removed)

## Privacy & Security

- Only you and the other participant can see your conversation
- Messages are private and not visible to other users
- You can only access conversations you're a part of
- All messaging activity is logged for security purposes
