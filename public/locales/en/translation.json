That’s where you’ll find us: Brian and Amanda, the husband-and-wife team behind Shadow and Sillage.",
      "two": "It started simply enough - one perfume too many to remember, one story too good to lose. We began keeping notes, first on scraps of paper, then in a ledger, and finally in this growing archive. What began as a way to track our collection became something larger: a gathering place for others who chase memories through scent.",
      "three": "This little speakeasy of fragrance runs on curiosity. Every new listing is a lead, every review a clue. The database grows quietly in the background, one house and one scent at a time, as we piece together the strange and beautiful puzzle of perfume. You might call it obsession; we call it devotion.",
      "four": "We built this place for the romantics and the detectives of scent — the ones who can find memory in a base note or joy in a single spark of aldehyde. If you notice a bottle missing from our shelves, you can send word through the forms scattered around the site. We’ll take the tip, follow the trail, and add it to the case file.",
      "five": "The door’s always open. Step in from the rain, hang your coat, and stay awhile. In Shadow and Sillage, every scent has a story, and every story deserves to be found."
