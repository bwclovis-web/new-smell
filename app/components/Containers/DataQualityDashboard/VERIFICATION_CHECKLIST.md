# DataQualityDashboard Refactoring - Verification Checklist

## Status: ✅ Refactoring Complete

The refactoring is now complete. Use this checklist to verify the dashboard works correctly in your application.

## Pre-Verification Setup

- [x] Hook extracted to `hooks/useFetchDataQualityStats.ts`
- [x] `DataQualityDashboardRefactored.tsx` updated to use real hook
- [x] `index.ts` updated to export refactored version
- [x] Route updated to use index export
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Tests created
- [x] No linting errors

## Functional Verification Checklist

### 1. Dashboard Loading ⏳

- [ ] Navigate to `/admin/data-quality`
- [ ] Verify loading indicator appears briefly
- [ ] Verify dashboard content loads successfully
- [ ] No console errors in browser DevTools

### 2. Summary Statistics Display 📊

- [ ] "Missing Information" card displays count
- [ ] "Duplicate Entries" card displays count
- [ ] "Missing House Info" card displays count
- [ ] "Houses With No Perfumes" card displays count
- [ ] All cards have proper styling (colored backgrounds)

### 3. Chart Visualizations 📈

- [ ] "Top Brands with Missing Data" bar chart renders
- [ ] "Top Brands with Duplicates" bar chart renders
- [ ] "Top Houses Missing Info" bar chart renders
- [ ] "Data Quality Trends" line chart renders
- [ ] Charts display data correctly
- [ ] Charts are responsive (resize browser to test)

### 4. Timeframe Selector 🕐

- [ ] Three buttons visible: "Last Week", "Last Month", "All Time"
- [ ] Default selection is "Last Month" (highlighted)
- [ ] Clicking "Last Week" updates data
- [ ] Clicking "All Time" updates data
- [ ] Active button has different styling
- [ ] Data updates correctly for each timeframe

### 5. Admin Controls (Admin Users Only) 👨‍💼

**Prerequisites**: Must be logged in as admin user

- [ ] "Download House Info CSV" button visible
- [ ] "Upload Edited CSV" button visible
- [ ] "Refresh Data" button visible
- [ ] Click "Download House Info CSV" - CSV file downloads
- [ ] Click "Upload Edited CSV" - file picker opens
- [ ] Upload valid CSV - dashboard refreshes
- [ ] Click "Refresh Data" - button shows "Refreshing..." then data updates

### 6. Houses with No Perfumes Table 🏠

**Prerequisites**: Database must have houses with no perfumes

- [ ] Table section appears if data exists
- [ ] Shows house name, type, and created date
- [ ] Table is scrollable if many entries
- [ ] Proper styling and formatting

### 7. Error Handling ❌

To test error handling, you may need to:

- [ ] Temporarily break API endpoint - verify error message displays
- [ ] Network offline - verify error handling
- [ ] Invalid timeframe - verify graceful handling
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly

### 8. Data Refresh & Caching 🔄

- [ ] Initial load fetches data from API
- [ ] Switching timeframes fetches fresh data
- [ ] Rapid timeframe switching is debounced (doesn't spam API)
- [ ] "Refresh Data" button forces fresh data
- [ ] After CSV upload, data auto-refreshes
- [ ] Check Network tab: verify cache-control headers

### 9. Performance ⚡

- [ ] Dashboard loads in reasonable time (< 2 seconds)
- [ ] No lag when switching timeframes
- [ ] Charts render smoothly
- [ ] No memory leaks (check Memory tab in DevTools)
- [ ] No unnecessary re-renders (check React DevTools Profiler)

### 10. Responsive Design 📱

- [ ] Desktop view (1920px+) - all cards in row
- [ ] Tablet view (768px-1024px) - 2 cards per row
- [ ] Mobile view (< 768px) - 1 card per column
- [ ] Charts remain readable on all screen sizes
- [ ] Admin controls stack properly on mobile

### 11. Browser Compatibility 🌐

Test in multiple browsers:

- [ ] Chrome/Edge (Chromium)
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Safari (if on Mac)
- [ ] Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

### 12. Console Logs 🔍

Check browser console for:

- [ ] No errors
- [ ] No warnings
- [ ] `[DATA QUALITY]` debug logs appear (expected)
- [ ] No 404s for missing resources

## Regression Testing

Ensure old functionality still works:

- [ ] Route accessible at `/admin/data-quality`
- [ ] Access restricted to admin users only
- [ ] API endpoint `/api/data-quality` still works
- [ ] Timeframe parameter passed correctly to API
- [ ] Force parameter passed correctly on refresh
- [ ] CSV handlers still work
- [ ] CSRF tokens work correctly

## Comparison Test (Original vs Refactored)

If you kept the original `DataQualityDashboard.tsx` as backup:

1. **Test Original**: Temporarily change `index.ts` to export original
2. **Test Refactored**: Change back to export refactored
3. **Compare**: Both should behave identically

- [ ] Both load successfully
- [ ] Both display same data
- [ ] Both charts look identical
- [ ] Both admin controls work same
- [ ] No differences in functionality

## Known Issues / Expected Behavior

- **Debouncing**: If you rapidly switch timeframes, only the last selection will trigger an API call (this is by design)
- **Force Refresh**: May take a few seconds as it regenerates reports
- **Empty States**: If no data exists, shows "No data available"
- **Admin Controls**: Only visible to admin users

## If Issues Found

1. **Check Console**: Look for errors or warnings
2. **Check Network**: Verify API calls are succeeding
3. **Check Props**: Verify correct props passed to components
4. **Compare with Original**: Does original version work?
5. **Check Hook**: Verify `useFetchDataQualityStats` returning correct data

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If critical issues found:

```typescript
// In app/components/Containers/DataQualityDashboard/index.ts
// Change from:
export { default } from './DataQualityDashboardRefactored'

// Back to:
export { default } from './DataQualityDashboard'
```

## Success Criteria

✅ All checklist items pass
✅ No console errors
✅ Performance is acceptable
✅ All features work as expected
✅ Admin users can manage data
✅ Non-admin users see dashboard only

## Post-Verification Cleanup

Once verified in production for a few days:

- [ ] Remove original `DataQualityDashboard.tsx` (currently kept as backup)
- [ ] Remove this verification checklist (or move to docs)
- [ ] Document refactoring pattern for other components
- [ ] Consider applying same pattern to other large components

## Notes

- Dashboard uses Chart.js for visualizations
- Data fetching hook includes 5-second debounce
- API endpoint may run Python scripts (can be slow)
- CSV operations require admin permissions
- Timeframe changes trigger fresh API calls
