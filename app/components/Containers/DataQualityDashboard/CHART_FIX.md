# Chart.js Canvas Reuse Error - Fix Applied ✅

## Problem

When navigating to the Data Quality Dashboard, the following error occurred:

```
Error: Canvas is already in use. Chart with ID 'X' must be destroyed 
before the canvas with ID '' can be reused.
```

## Root Cause

This error happens with `react-chartjs-2` when:
1. Chart components re-render without properly destroying previous chart instances
2. React's reconciliation tries to reuse canvas elements
3. Chart.js attempts to create a new chart on a canvas that already has one

## Solution Applied

### 1. Register Chart.js Components Globally
Created `utils/chartSetup.ts` to register Chart.js components once:

```tsx
// utils/chartSetup.ts
import { BarElement, CategoryScale, Chart as ChartJS, ... } from 'chart.js'

ChartJS.register(
  CategoryScale,
  LinearScale,
  BarElement,
  LineElement,
  PointElement,
  Title,
  Tooltip,
  Legend
)
```

**Why this works**: Ensures Chart.js plugins are registered before any charts render, preventing initialization errors.

### 2. Added Unique Keys AND IDs
Each chart now has both a unique React key AND a Chart.js ID based on timeframe:

```tsx
// ChartVisualizations.tsx
const chartId = `missing-data-chart-${timeframe}`
<Bar key={chartId} id={chartId} ... />
```

**Why this works**: 
- React `key` ensures proper component lifecycle management
- Chart.js `id` ensures each chart instance has a unique canvas identifier
- When timeframe changes, both key and ID change, forcing complete recreation

### 3. Removed `redraw={true}` Prop
Removed the `redraw` prop which was causing issues on initial load:

```tsx
// Before (caused issues)
<Bar redraw={true} ... />

// After (stable)
<Bar key={chartId} id={chartId} ... />
```

**Why this works**: The `redraw` prop forces recreation on EVERY render, even the initial one, which can cause race conditions. Using keys is more predictable.

### 3. Passed Timeframe to Chart Components
Updated component interfaces to receive the timeframe prop:

- `ChartVisualizations` now accepts `timeframe` prop
- `TrendChart` now accepts `timeframe` prop
- `DashboardContent` passes timeframe to both components

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `utils/chartSetup.ts` (NEW)
   - Registers all Chart.js components globally
   - Prevents initialization errors
   - Imported in main dashboard component

2. ✅ `utils/index.ts`
   - Exports chartSetup module

3. ✅ `components/ChartVisualizations.tsx`
   - Added `timeframe` prop to interface
   - Generates unique IDs for each chart
   - Adds both `key` and `id` props to Bar charts
   - Spreads chartOptions with maintainAspectRatio
   - Added React import

4. ✅ `components/TrendChart.tsx`
   - Added `timeframe` prop to interface
   - Generates unique ID for chart
   - Adds both `key` and `id` props to Line chart
   - Added maintainAspectRatio to options
   - Added React import

5. ✅ `components/DashboardContent.tsx`
   - Passes `timeframe` to ChartVisualizations
   - Passes `timeframe` to TrendChart

6. ✅ `DataQualityDashboardRefactored.tsx`
   - Imports './utils/chartSetup' to register Chart.js

7. ✅ `DataQualityDashboard.test.tsx`
   - Added mocks for ChartVisualizations and TrendChart

## How It Works Now

```
App initializes
    ↓
chartSetup.ts registers Chart.js components globally
    ↓
Dashboard mounts with timeframe="month" (default)
    ↓
Charts render with unique keys AND ids:
  - key="missing-data-chart-month" id="missing-data-chart-month"
  - key="duplicates-chart-month" id="duplicates-chart-month"
  - key="missing-house-info-chart-month" id="missing-house-info-chart-month"
  - key="trend-chart-month" id="trend-chart-month"
    ↓
Each chart creates its own canvas with unique ID
    ↓
User selects "Last Week" timeframe
    ↓
React sees different keys, destroys old charts, creates new ones
    ↓
New charts get new IDs: "...-week" instead of "...-month"
    ↓
No canvas reuse errors! ✅
```

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. Navigate to `/admin/data-quality`
2. Wait for dashboard to load
3. Switch between timeframes (Week/Month/All)
4. Check browser console for errors
5. Verify charts update correctly

**Expected**: No canvas reuse errors, smooth chart transitions

## Additional Benefits

- **Clean state**: Each timeframe gets fresh chart instances
- **Better performance**: React knows when to properly unmount/remount
- **Predictable behavior**: No stale chart data or state
- **Memory management**: Old charts are properly destroyed

## Alternative Approaches (Considered but Not Used)

### 1. Using `redraw={true}` Prop ❌
```tsx
<Bar redraw={true} ... />
```
**Why not used**: Causes issues on initial load, forces recreation on EVERY render including the first mount, leading to race conditions

### 2. Manual Chart Destruction
```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    chartRef.current?.destroy()
  }
}, [])
```
**Why not used**: More complex, less declarative, harder to maintain

### 3. Single Static Key
```tsx
<Bar key="static-chart-key" />
```
**Why not used**: Doesn't help with canvas reuse on timeframe changes

### 4. Random Keys
```tsx
<Bar key={Math.random()} />
```
**Why not used**: Recreates charts unnecessarily on every render, terrible performance

## React Strict Mode Compatibility

The solution works correctly in React Strict Mode (development):
- Strict Mode causes double mounting to detect side effects
- Our approach using unique `key` + `id` handles this gracefully
- Each mount gets a unique chart instance
- No canvas reuse even with double renders

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal**: Charts only recreate when timeframe actually changes
- **Debouncing**: Hook already prevents rapid API calls
- **User experience**: Smooth, no noticeable lag

## Known Limitations

- Charts will briefly unmount/remount when timeframe changes
- This is expected behavior and provides clean state
- Very fast transitions may show a brief flash (acceptable trade-off)

## Future Improvements

1. Add fade transitions during chart recreation
2. Consider React.memo for chart components if performance issues arise
3. Monitor for memory leaks in long sessions

## Related Issues

- Chart.js canvas reuse is a common issue in React
- react-chartjs-2 v5+ provides better cleanup
- React 18 Strict Mode can expose these issues in development
