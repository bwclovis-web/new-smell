# Admin User Deletion Feature

## Overview

Added a comprehensive user management system for admins to safely delete users from the admin interface, with proper data handling and audit logging.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Safe User Deletion System** (`app/models/admin.server.ts`)

- **Hard Delete**: Permanently removes user and ALL related data
- **Soft Delete**: Marks user as deleted but preserves data
- **Transaction Safety**: Uses Prisma transactions to ensure data consistency
- **Audit Logging**: Logs all deletion actions for security monitoring
- **Safety Checks**: Prevents deletion of admin users and self-deletion

### 2. **Admin User Management Page** (`app/routes/admin/users.tsx`)

- **User List**: Shows all users with their data counts
- **Role Display**: Visual indicators for user roles (admin, editor, user)
- **Data Overview**: Shows total records per user (perfumes, ratings, reviews, etc.)
- **Action Buttons**: Soft delete and hard delete options
- **Confirmation Modal**: Prevents accidental deletions
- **Real-time Feedback**: Success/error messages for all actions

### 3. **Navigation Integration**

- Added "User Management" to admin navigation menu
- Only visible to admin users
- Accessible at `/admin/users`

## Safety Features

### **Data Protection**

- ✅ **Cascade Delete**: Properly removes all related records
- ✅ **Transaction Safety**: All-or-nothing deletion process
- ✅ **Admin Protection**: Cannot delete admin users
- ✅ **Self-Protection**: Cannot delete your own account
- ✅ **Audit Trail**: All actions logged in SecurityAuditLog

### **User Experience**

- ✅ **Confirmation Modal**: Clear warnings before deletion
- ✅ **Data Counts**: Shows how much data will be deleted
- ✅ **Visual Indicators**: Different styling for deleted users
- ✅ **Loading States**: Prevents double-clicks during processing
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for failed operations

## Usage

### **Access the Feature**

1. Log in as an admin user
2. Navigate to Admin Panel
3. Click "User Management" in the sidebar
4. View all users with their data counts

### **Delete a User**

1. Find the user in the list
2. Click "Soft Delete" or "Delete" button
3. Confirm the action in the modal
4. User will be removed/deactivated

### **Two Delete Options**

#### **Soft Delete** (Recommended)

- Marks user as deleted (email prefixed with `deleted_`)
- Preserves all user data
- User cannot log in
- Data can be recovered if needed

#### **Hard Delete** (Permanent)

- Permanently removes user and ALL data
- Cannot be undone
- Frees up database space
- Use only when certain data is not needed

## Database Impact

### **Related Data Deleted** (Hard Delete)

- `UserPerfume` - User's perfume collection
- `UserPerfumeRating` - User's ratings
- `UserPerfumeReview` - User's reviews
- `UserPerfumeWishlist` - User's wishlist
- `UserPerfumeComment` - User's comments
- `UserAlert` - User's alerts
- `WishlistNotification` - User's notifications
- `UserAlertPreferences` - User's alert preferences
- `SecurityAuditLog` - User's audit logs

### **Audit Logging**

All deletion actions are logged with:

- Admin who performed the action
- User who was deleted
- Type of deletion (hard/soft)
- Number of records deleted
- Timestamp and details

## Security Considerations

### **Access Control**

- Only admin users can access the feature
- Server-side validation prevents unauthorized access
- CSRF protection on all forms

### **Data Integrity**

- Foreign key constraints prevent orphaned data
- Transaction rollback on any failure
- Comprehensive error handling

### **Audit Trail**

- All actions logged in SecurityAuditLog
- Includes admin ID, action type, and details
- Can be used for compliance and security monitoring

## Files Created/Modified

### **New Files**

- `app/models/admin.server.ts` - Server-side user management functions
- `app/routes/admin/users.tsx` - Admin user management page

### **Modified Files**

- `app/data/navigation.ts` - Added user management to admin menu
- `app/routes.ts` - Added users route to admin layout

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Access Control**

   - Verify only admins can access `/admin/users`
   - Test that regular users get 403 error

2. **Test User Deletion**

   - Test soft delete functionality
   - Test hard delete functionality
   - Verify data is properly removed
   - Check audit logs are created

3. **Test Safety Features**

   - Try to delete admin user (should fail)
   - Try to delete your own account (should fail)
   - Verify confirmation modal works

4. **Test Error Handling**
   - Test with invalid user IDs
   - Test network failures
   - Verify error messages are clear

## Future Enhancements

- **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple users for batch operations
- **User Search**: Filter users by name, email, or role
- **User Details**: Click to view detailed user information
- **Restore Function**: Undo soft deletions
- **Export Data**: Download user data before deletion
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by registration date, activity, etc.
